	abstract = {Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) may be a key technology for achieving large CO2 emission reductions. Relative to “normal” CCS, “flexible” CCS retrofits include solvent storage that allows the generator to temporarily reduce the CCS parasitic load and increase the generator’s net efficiency, capacity, and ramp rate. Due to this flexibility, flexible CCS generators provide system benefits that normal CCS generators do not, which could make flexible CCS an economic CO2 emission reduction strategy. Here, we estimate the system-level cost effectiveness of reducing CO2 emissions with flexible CCS compared to redispatching (i.e., substituting gas- for coal-fired electricity generation), wind, and normal CCS under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and a hypothetical more stringent CO2 emission reduction target (“stronger CPP”). Using a unit commitment and economic dispatch model, we find flexible CCS achieves more cost-effective emission reductions than normal CCS under both reduction targets, indicating that policies that promote CCS should encourage flexible CCS. However, flexible CCS is less cost effective than wind under both reduction targets and less and more cost effective than redispatching under the CPP and stronger CPP, respectively. Thus, CCS will likely be a minor CPP compliance strategy but may play a larger role under a stronger emission reduction target.},

	abstract = {This presentation provides an overview of the formulation for operating reserves in the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS), a capacity expansion model. It describes the three reserve products modeled in ReEDS--regulation, spinning (contingency), and flexibility--and highlights recent updates to the modeling approach, including modifications to how storage provides reserves, the constraints on commitment for generators that provide reserves, and the costs for thermal units to provide spinning reserve. The presentation benchmarks operating reserve provision in ReEDS against comparable simulations in PLEXOS, finding that the improved formulation is different but yields results that are holistically similar to those in production cost modeling. In this presentation we also investigate the impact of different reserve options in the model (e.g., allowing wind and solar to provide operating reserves) on the solution. The results thus far indicate that most switches related to operating reserves exert little influence on the outcome on the results. Future work will continue to explore operating reserves in capacity expansion models, particularly for models with different temporal resolution.},

	abstract = {The relationship between battery operation and their degradation and service life is complex and not well synthesized or communicated. There is a resulting lack of awareness about best practices that influence service life and degradation. Battery degradation causes premature replacement or product retirement, resulting in environmental burdens from producing and processing new battery materials, as well as early end-of-life burdens. It also imposes a significant cost on the user, as batteries can contribute to over 25\% of the product cost for consumer electronics, over 35\% for electric vehicles, and over 50\% for power tools. We review and present mechanisms, methods, and guidelines focused on preserving battery health and limiting degradation. The review includes academic literature as well as reports and information published by industry. The goal is to provide practical guidance, metrics, and methods to improve environmental performance of battery systems used in electronics (i.e., cellphones and laptops), vehicles, and cordless power tools to ultimately better inform users as well as battery designers, suppliers, vehicle and device manufacturers, and material recovery and recycling organizations.},

We estimate and monetize the resulting human health and environmental damages from life cycle air emissions for each vehicle technology. We model PJM using the most recent data available (2010) as well as projections of the PJM grid in 2018 and a hypothetical scenario with increased wind penetration. We assess a range of sensitivity cases to verify the robustness of our results. We find that PEVs have higher life cycle air emissions damages than gasoline HEVs in the recent grid scenario, which has a high percentage of coal generation on the margin. In particular, battery electric vehicles with large battery capacity can produce two to three times as much air emissions damage as gasoline HEVs, depending on charge timing. In our future 2018 grid scenarios that account for predicted coal plant retirements, PEVs would produce air emissions damages comparable to or slightly lower than HEVs.},

The analysis indicates that energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are the core elements of that transition, and their synergies are likewise important. Favourable economics, ubiquitous resources, scalable technology, and significant socio-economic benefits underpin such a transition. Renewable energy can supply two-thirds of the total global energy demand, and contribute to the bulk of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction that is needed between now and 2050 for limiting average global surface temperature increase below 2 °C. Enabling policy and regulatory frameworks will need to be adjusted to mobilise the six-fold acceleration of renewables growth that is needed, with the highest growth estimated for wind and solar PV technologies, complemented by a high level of energy efficiency. Still, to ensure the eventual elimination of carbon dioxide emissions will require new technology and innovation, notably for the transport and manufacturing sectors, which remain largely ignored in the international debate.

Electric vehicles (EV) are considered as the preferred alternative to address these problems by means of reducing the use of fossil energy. After implementing many years of the incentive policy, the market share of electric vehicles has experienced great growth in China. Recently, the government considers the phase-out of the subsidy within 3 years. In this study, based on the 2017 social accounting matrix (SAM), we build a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. And five scenarios are developed to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of the policy changes, specifically, the decreasing subsidy and the sustained technological progress requirements. The results reveal that both the subsidy and technological progress can contribute to the economic growth, and a 30\% cutback of subsidy does weaken the economic benefit by 23.5\%-33.3\%. And the subsidy increases the overall emissions greatly while technological progress contributes to emission reductions. Another finding is that the substitution ratio between ICEV and EV is roughly 1:3 under the effect of the subsidy. However, technological progress provides a ratio of 1:1.3, close to the perfect 1:1 substitution commonly assumed in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. Our study suggests that compared with the subsidy, encouraging technological progress is a more sustainable option for policy-making.},

	abstract = {The transportation sector is at the beginning of a transition represented by electrification, shared mobility, and automation, which could lead to either increases or decreases in total travel and energy use. Understanding the factors enabling deep decarbonization of the passenger vehicle sector is essential for planning the required infrastructure investments and technology adoption policies. We examine the requirements for meeting carbon reduction targets of 80\% and higher for passenger vehicle transport in the United States (US) by midcentury under uncertainty. We model the changes needed in vehicle electrification, electricity carbon intensity, and travel demand. Since growth in fleet penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) is constrained by fleet stock turnover, we estimate the EV penetration rates needed to meet climate targets. We find for a base case level of passenger vehicle travel, midcentury deep decarbonization of US passenger transport is conditional on reducing the electricity generation carbon intensity to close to zero along with electrification of about 67\% or 84\% of vehicle travel to meet decarbonization targets of 80\% or 90\%, respectively. Higher electricity generation carbon intensity and degraded EV fuel economy due to automation would require higher levels of fleet electrification and/or further constrain the total vehicle travel allowable. Transportation deep decarbonization not only depends on electricity decarbonization, but also has a total travel budget, representing a maximum total vehicle travel threshold that still enables meeting a midcentury climate target. This makes encouraging ride sharing, reducing total vehicle travel, and increasing fuel economy in both human-driven and future automated vehicles increasingly important to deep decarbonization.},

No research quantifies the feasibility and costs of such an undertaking across the United States. Complicating such an undertaking are workers' place-based preferences that could prevent them from moving long distances, e.g. to high renewable resource regions.

	abstract = {The cost of utility-scale photovoltaics (PV) has declined rapidly over the past decade. Yet increased renewable electricity generation, decreased natural gas prices, and deployment of emissions-control technology across the United States have led to concurrent changes in electricity prices and power system emissions rates, each of which influence the value of PV electricity. An ongoing assessment of the economic competitiveness of PV is therefore necessary as PV cost and value continue to evolve. Here, we use historical nodal electricity prices, capacity market prices, marginal power system emissions rates of CO2 and air pollutants, and weather data to model the energy, capacity, health, and climate value of PV electricity at over 10 000 locations across six U.S. Independent System Operators (ISOs) from 2010 to 2017. On the energy and capacity markets, transmission congestion in some locations and years results in PV revenues that are more than double the median across the relevant ISO. While the marginal public health benefits from avoided SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions have declined over time in most ISOs, monetizing the health benefits of PV generation in 2017 would increase median PV energy revenues by 70\% in MISO and NYISO and 100\% in PJM. Given 2017 PV costs, electricity prices, and grid conditions, PV breaks even at 30\% of modeled locations on the basis of energy, capacity, and health benefits, at 75\% of modeled locations with the addition of a 50 \$/ton CO2 price, and at 100\% of modeled locations with a 100 \$/ton CO2 price. These results suggest that PV cost decline has outpaced value decline over the past decade, such that in 2017 the net benefits of utility-scale PV outweigh the cost at the majority of modeled locations.},

We use an electric power system model to explicitly evaluate the change in generator dispatches resulting from PHEV deployment in the Texas grid, and apply fixed and non-parametric estimates of generator emissions rates, to estimate the resulting changes in generation emissions. We find that by using the flexibility of when vehicles may be charged, generator efficiency can be increased substantially. By changing generator dispatch, a PHEV fleet of up to 15\% of light-duty vehicles can actually decrease net generator NOx emissions during the ozone season, despite the additional charging load. By adding V2G services, such as spinning reserves and energy storage, CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions can be reduced even further.},

In the future, however, stabilization might be provided by electric vehicles operating under the smart-grid framework. Departing from this, this paper discusses and quantifies to what extent electric vehicles are required to be possible to shut down gas power plants. The analysis is performed using the EnergyPLAN tool, for the case study of the Portuguese power system in 2050. The results suggest that even a small share of the fleet of electric vehicles providing load balancing could lead to important reductions in gas use and energy excess. The gas share in the electricity mix is reduced from 10.2\% without electric vehicles providing for stabilization to zero with 30\% of the fleet providing it; the energy excess is reduced from 1.5\% to zero above 15\% of electric vehicles stabilizing the grid. Therefore, to achieve a power system without fossil fuels, electric vehicles capable of supporting the grid should be developed and adopted, as should be promoted the market and regulatory conditions to allow this.},

Prior analyses have quantified potential V2G revenues, but each has ignored at least one of four factors that could drive future V2G revenues: future grid changes, large EV numbers, V2G interactions with electricity prices, and V2G operational responses to shifts in electricity prices. Our innovation is the capture of all four factors to quantify net revenues of a fleet of V2G-enabled EVs in California through 2030 by co-simulating optimization models for V2G and power system operations. We find V2G-enabled EVs generate an average of \$32-\$48 more annual net revenues than smart-charging EVs. Declining electricity prices through 2030 due to decarbonization and V2G participation decreases V2G revenues, and ignoring fleet-wide V2G participation significantly overestimates V2G annual net revenues. Overall, these results indicate V2G revenues could be modest and decrease in the future, underscoring the value of our co-optimization framework.},

Most studies of future scenarios indicate that VRE reduces wholesale energy prices and capacity factors of thermal generators. Traditional baseload generators are more exposed to these changing market conditions than low-capital cost and more flexible intermediate and peak-load generators. From analysis of historical data we find that VRE is already influencing the bulk power market through changes in temporal and geographic patterns areas with higher levels of VRE. The most significant observed impacts have concentrated in areas with significant VRE and/or nuclear generation along with limited transmission, with negative pricing also often occurring during periods with lower system-wide load. So far, however, VRE, has had a relatively modest impact on historical average annual wholesale prices across entire market regions, at least in comparison to other drivers. The reduction of natural gas prices is the primary contributor to the decline in wholesale prices since 2008. Similarly, VRE impacts on thermal plant retirements have been limited and there is little relationship between the location of recent retirements and VRE penetration levels. Although impacts on wholesale prices have been modest so far, impacts of VRE on the electricity market will be more significant under higher VRE penetrations.},

	abstract = {We synthesize available literature, data, and analysis on the degree to which growth in variable renewable energy (VRE) has impacted to date or might in the future impact bulk power system assets, pricing, and costs. We do not analyze impacts on specific power plants, instead focusing on national and regional system-level trends. The issues addressed are highly context dependent—affected by the underlying generation mix of the system, the amount of wind and solar penetration, and the design and structure of the bulk power system in each region. Moreover, analyzing the impacts of VRE on the bulk power system is a complex area of research and there is much more to be done to increase understanding of how VRE impacts the dynamics of current and future electricity markets. While more analysis is warranted, including additional location-specific assessments, several high-level findings emerge from this synthesis: -VRE Is Already Impacting the Bulk Power Market -VRE Impacts on Average Wholesale Prices Have Been Modest -VRE Impacts on Power Plant Retirements Have So Far Been Limited -VRE Impacts on the Bulk Power Market will Grow with Penetration -The ’System Value’ of VRE will Decline with Penetration -Power System Flexibility Can Reduce the Rate of VRE Value Decline All generation types are unique in some respect—bringing benefits and challenges to the power system—and wholesale markets, industry investments, and operational procedures have evolved over time to manage the characteristics of a changing generation fleet. With increased VRE penetrations, power system planners, operators, regulators, and policymakers will continue to be challenged to develop methods to smoothly and cost-effectively manage the reliable integration of these new and growing sources of electricity supply.},

Capturing variable renewable power requires the use of energy storage to shift generation and load demand. The integration of plug-in electric vehicles, however, impacts the load demand profile and therefore the capacity of energy storage required to meet renewable utilization targets. This study examines how the intelligence of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) integration impacts the required capacity of energy storage systems to meet renewable utilization targets for a large-scale energy system, using California as an example for meeting a 50\% and 80\% renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 2030 and 2050. For an 80\% RPS in 2050, immediate charging of PEVs requires the installation of an aggregate energy storage system with a power capacity of 60\% of the installed renewable capacity and an energy capacity of 2.3\% of annual renewable generation. With smart charging of PEVs, required power capacity drops to 16\% and required energy capacity drops to 0.6\%, and with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging, non-vehicle energy storage systems are no longer required. Overall, this study highlights the importance of intelligent PEV charging for minimizing the scale of infrastructure required to meet renewable utilization targets.},

At the same time, renewable energy can be used for a microgrid nearby, or incorporated into a large grid, to effectively address the volatility of renewable energy sources. Motivated by the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the randomness of renewable energy output, this paper proposes an effective strategy to improve the security and economy of the microgrid system. The uncertainty of wind power and EV’s state of charge (SOC) is modeled as uncertainty prediction sets. And considering the worst-case scenario, this proposed strategy can increase the absorption ratio of renewable energy while orderly guiding the charging and discharging of EVs in peak-load reduction and valley filling and thus, lower operating costs under various practical constraints. To solve the problem of over-conservatism of the robust optimization, this paper introduces a dispatch interval coefficient to adjust the degree of conservatism, while improving the economy of microgrids system. The robustness and feasibility of the proposed dispatch strategy are demonstrated by numerical case studies.},

For example, the gradual displacement of fossil-fuelled vehicles with electrically driven counterparts will inevitably increase both the power grid baseload and peak demand. In many developed countries, the electrification process of the transport sector has already started in tandem with the installation of multi-GW renewable energy capacity, particularly wind and solar, huge investment in power storage technology, and end-user energy demand management. The expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market presents a new opportunity to create a cleaner and transformative new energy carrier. For instance, a managed EV battery charging and discharging profile in conjunction with the national grid, known as the Vehicle-to-Grid system (V2G), is projected to be an important mechanism in reducing the impact of renewable energy intermittency. This paper presents an extensive literature review of the current status of EVs and allied interface technology with the power grid. The main findings and statistical details are drawn from up-to-date publications highlighting the latest technological advancements, limitations, and potential future market development. The authors believe that electric vehicle technology will bring huge technological innovation to the energy market where the vehicle will serve both as a means of transport and a dynamic energy vector interfacing with the grid (V2G), buildings (V2B), and others (V2X).},

	abstract = {A study has been performed to understand the quantitative impact of key differences between vehicle-to-grid and stationary energy storage systems on renewable utilization, greenhouse gas emissions, and balancing fleet operation, using California as the example. To simulate the combined electricity and light-duty transportation system, a detailed electric grid dispatch model (including stationary energy storage systems) was combined with an electric vehicle charging dispatch model that incorporates conventional smart and vehicle-to-grid capabilities. By subjecting smaller amounts of renewable energy to round-trip efficiency losses and thereby increasing the efficiency of renewable utilization, it was found that vehicle-to-grid energy storage can achieve higher renewable utilization levels and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to stationary energy storage systems. Vehicle-to-grid energy storage, however, is not as capable of balancing the power plant fleet compared to stationary energy storage systems due to the constraints of consumer travel patterns. The potential benefits of vehicle-to-grid are strongly dependent on the availability of charging infrastructure at both home and workplaces, with potential benefits being compromised with residential charging availability only. Overall, vehicle-to-grid energy storage can provide benefits over stationary energy storage depending on the system attribute selected for improvement, a finding amenable to managing through policy.},

	abstract = {Methane mitigation is essential for addressing climate change, but the value of rapidly implementing available mitigation measures is not well understood. In this paper, we analyze the climate benefits of fast action to reduce methane emissions as compared to slower and delayed mitigation timelines. We find that the scale up and deployment of greatly underutilized but available mitigation measures will have significant near-term temperature benefits beyond that from slow or delayed action. Overall, strategies exist to cut global methane emissions from human activities in half within the next ten years and half of these strategies currently incur no net cost. Pursuing all mitigation measures now could slow the global-mean rate of near-term decadal warming by around 30\%, avoid a quarter of a degree centigrade of additional global-mean warming by midcentury, and set ourselves on a path to avoid more than half a degree centigrade by end of century. On the other hand, slow implementation of these measures may result in an additional tenth of a degree of global-mean warming by midcentury and 5\% faster warming rate (relative to fast action), and waiting to pursue these measures until midcentury may result in an additional two tenths of a degree centigrade by midcentury and 15\% faster warming rate (relative to fast action). Slow or delayed methane action is viewed by many as reasonable given that current and on-the-horizon climate policies heavily emphasize actions that benefit the climate in the long-term, such as decarbonization and reaching net-zero emissions, whereas methane emitted over the next couple of decades will play a limited role in long-term warming. However, given that fast methane action can considerably limit climate damages in the near-term, it is urgent to scale up efforts and take advantage of this achievable and affordable opportunity as we simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide emissions.},

Therefore, it is important to assess their penetration in the vehicle market in the future. A ‘two-step’ approach is used to estimate the optimum market penetration of lightweight and electric-drive vehicles in the long-term and the impact on the light-duty vehicle fleet, focusing on Japan. First, an optimization model is used to estimate the vehicle market composition in 2050. Then, a vehicle stock turnover model is used to estimate light-duty vehicle fleet energy and material consumption, CO2 emissions and cost. Internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles dominate in the Base scenario. Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles dominate when low cost is prioritized. Shift to battery electric vehicles occurs when low CO2 emissions are prioritized. CO2 emissions are reduced 56.9\% between 2012 and 2050 in the Base scenario. Lightweight mini-sized battery electric vehicle diffusion has the largest CO2 emissions reductions, 87.3\% compared to the 2050 baseline value; with the net cash flow peaking at 10.2 billion USD/year in 2035 and becoming negative after 2044.},

In the United States, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) cap-and-trade program is used to reduce emissions. In this paper, I use detailed state-level data to estimate the impact of RGGI on coal and natural gas consumption in the electric-power industry. I find the program directly caused coal and natural gas phase-outs within regulated states. Specifically, the program decreased coal and natural gas consumption for electricity generation by 73\% and 30\%, respectively, within regulated states. However, in nearby, un-regulated states, I find an increase in natural-gas consumption of 237\% and a decrease in coal consumption of 7\%. As a result, the program reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 4.8 million tons annually in regulated states, but increased carbon dioxide emissions by 3.5 million tons in unregulated states. I also find the program decreased the efficiency of coal-fired and gas-fired plants, which reduces the program's effectiveness for lowering emissions. However, overall, the program reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 1.3 million tons per year.},

Leakage negates some emission reductions from the regulated regions. We use detailed electricity generation and transmission data to show that this is the case for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a CO2 cap-and-trade program for the electricity sector in select Northeastern U.S. states. More specifically, our results indicate that RGGI induced a reduction in coal-fired generation in RGGI states and an increase in NGCC generation in RGGI-surrounding regions. This finding suggests that the pollution haven hypothesis holds for state-level variation in environmental policy, even when compliance costs are low.},

This paper proposes a method for assessing the impacts of forecast errors in wind and solar generation outputs on a unit commitment problem. An iterative process is used across different spinning reserve requirements until the hourly average and intrahour variation forecast errors in demand and renewable energy generation are fully compensated at the lowest cost. The process, containing time series simulations, is applied to various confidence levels of the forecasted renewable energy generation so that violations of the frequency limit will not occur in the normal operation.

	abstract = {The international passenger car market is undergoing a transition from vehicles with internal combustion engines to hybrid and fully electrified vehicles to reduce the climate impact of the transportation sector. To emphasize the importance of this needed change, this paper provides holistic comparisons of the total life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by a wide selection of commercially available passenger cars with different powertrains and energy sources. Simple analytical models are used to quantify the total life-cycle GHG emissions in terms of CO2-equivalent values relative to the vehicle curb weight and the peak motor power. The production, utilization and recycling emissions are separately quantified based on the latest reviewed emission coefficient values. In total 790 different vehicle variants are considered. The results show that Battery Electric Vehicles have the highest production emissions. For example, the additional production emissions of a Tesla Model 3 Standard Plus approximately correspond to the driving emissions of a Volkwagen Passat 2.0 TSI after 18 000km. Nonetheless, it is shown that conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles emit the highest amount of total life-cycle GHGs in comparison to vehicles powered by other available energy resources. When using green electricity, plug-in hybrid electric and fully electric vehicles can reduce the total life-cycle emission in comparison to combustion engine vehicles by 73\% and 89\%, respectively. A similar emission reduction is achieved by biogas powered vehicles (81\%). Fuel cell vehicles approximately reduce the GHG emission to a similar extent as electric vehicles (charged with conventional electricity) when using commercially available gray hydrogen (60\%).},

To this end, we present ReDyFEV, a simple open-source software tool that can be used to calculate attributional, regionalized lifecycle climate impacts of BEVs in Europe for user-defined time periods, including near real-time. We determine the national lifecycle carbon footprints across all EU states for four BEV size segments and compare them to those of fossil-fuelled vehicles of similar sizes. Simplified sensitivity analyses investigate the effect of lifetime assumptions, electricity demand in battery production, and of relocating battery production to Europe on the carbon footprints of BEVs.},

	abstract = {Purpose
This study uses the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to calculate and compare the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and conventional gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in 2010, 2014 and 2020 under different scenarios, including different electricity mixes, electricity generation technologies and combined heat and power (CHP) scales, as well as discusses the GHG emission reduction potential of BEVs throughout their life cycle.
Methods
The LCA system boundaries, including the vehicle cycle and the fuel cycle, are examined in accordance with the ISO 14040/14044 standards. The China Automotive Life Cycle Database (CALCD), which is the first and primary life cycle database of the China automotive industry, was used. The compositional data for the vehicle components and the battery material were obtained from the GREET2 2017 model.
Results and discussion
As the electricity mix is optimized, the electricity generation technology is advanced, and the CHP scale is increased from 2010 to 2020, the total life cycle GHG reduction potential of BEVs will gradually improve, reaching 13.4\% in 2020, relative to ICEVs.
Conclusions
The sensitivity analysis shows that the GHG emissions from electricity, the percentage of fossil fuel in the electricity mix and the electricity consumption of the BEV during use are important parameters influencing the GHG emission reduction potential of BEVs. By adjusting the electricity mix, advancing electricity generation technologies and increasing the CHP scale, the GHG emission reduction potential of BEVs can be improved.},

A discrete choice model is adopted with consideration of variables including vehicle technical characteristics, fuel prices, charging conditions and support policies. Results show that by 2030, without technological breakthrough and support policies, the market share of EV will be less than 7\%, with gasoline dominating the energy structure. With fast technological progress, charging facility establishment, subsidies and tax breaks, EVs will account for 70\% of annual new vehicle sales and nearly half of the vehicle stock by 2030, resulting in the substitution of nearly 1 million tons of gasoline with 3.2 billion kWh electricity in 2030 and the reduction of 0.6 million tons of CO2 emission in 2030. Technological progress, charging conditions and fuel prices are the top three drivers. Subsidies play an important role in the early stage, while tax and supply-side policies can be good options as long-term incentives.},

	abstract = {The developments in electric vehicles (EVs) are driven by the need for cleaner and more efficient road transport. Despite the benefits of electrifying the transport sector, both EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles add to road congestion. Major cities around the world have thus employed vehicle control measures to rein the growth rate of vehicle populations. In the case of Singapore, heavy taxes are levied onto the purchase price of all vehicles registered and sold in the country making it literally the most expensive city to own a car. EVs are also penalized under the taxation scheme implemented in Singapore. The vehicle taxation schemes and the absence of incentive measures for EVs make Singapore the worst-case market environment for EV adoption. Through a dissection of Singapore’s vehicle control measures, a new business model is proposed for promoting the adoption of EVs under Singapore’s market environment. The proposed business model, inspired by telecommunication companies' mobile phone purchase contract aims at reducing the upfront purchase price of EVs via quasi-discount by vehicle dealers without affecting the transport sector tax revenues. Under a contractual arrangement over usage and electricity tariff managed by vehicle dealers, EV buyers effectively pay back the discounted upfront cost over a fixed period of time. Through an examination over a range of repayment periods and their impacts on costs, we find that the repayment period has virtually no impact on the total cost of vehicle ownership. We further contemplate that the same business model can be applicable to all cities in promoting the adoption of EVs without affecting the existing policy infrastructure.},

Publicly, we survey the literature documenting the external costs and benefits of EVs and highlight several themes for optimal policy design including, 1) promoting regional variation in EV policies that align private incentives with social benefits, 2) pursuing a time-path of policies that reflect changing marginal benefits, and 3) rationalizing electricity and gasoline prices to reflect their social marginal cost. On the extensive margin, purchase incentives should ramp-down as learning-by-doing and network externalities (to the extent that they exist) diminish; on the intensive margin, gasoline should become relatively more expensive over time than electricity (per mile traveled) to reflect cleaner marginal emissions from electricity generation.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) were recently reintroduced to the global car market. These are an improvement over their predecessors in performance and electric driving range. Although the uptake of EVs has been notable in a short period of time, most government goals for adoption have not been met. This paper reviews a growing body of peer-reviewed literature assessing factors affecting EV adoption. Several important gaps in knowledge are identified. First, there is mixed evidence of the effectiveness of government incentives in encouraging EV uptake and particularly little knowledge in regards to issues of timing and magnitude. The literature shows that public charging infrastructure is an important factor associated with EV uptake, though the direction of causality is yet unclear. Public charging infrastructure can ease range anxiety, particularly for battery electric vehicles, but there is little guidance as to the way in which government should best go about ensuring the provision of infrastructure. Lastly, the nascent EV market means that studies primarily rely on surveys about hypothetical situations. There is strong evidence that actual purchases are much lower than consumers’ stated preferences. Improving understanding of this “attitude–action” gap is important to better informing studies of EV uptake over time.},

	abstract = {Exposure to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular conditions and is a leading source of premature mortality globally. Organic aerosol contributes a significant fraction of PM in the United States. Here, using surface observations between 1990 and 2012, we show that organic carbon has declined dramatically across the entire United States by 25–50\%; accounting for more than 30\% of the US-wide decline in PM. The decline is in contrast with the increasing organic aerosol due to wildfires and no clear trend in biogenic emissions. By developing a carbonaceous emissions database for the United States, we show that at least two-thirds of the decline in organic aerosol can be explained by changes in anthropogenic emissions, primarily from vehicle emissions and residential fuel burning. We estimate that the decrease in anthropogenic organic aerosol is responsible for averting 180,000 (117,000–389,000) premature deaths between 1990 and 2012. The unexpected decrease in organic aerosol, likely a consequence of the implementation of Clean Air Act Amendments, results in 84,000 (30,000–164,000) more lives saved than anticipated by the EPA between 2000 and 2010.},

	abstract = {US Environmental Protection Agency estimates of on-road vehicle emissions are compared with ambient measurements and a fuel-based emission inventory. Several significant weaknesses and strengths are identified. (1) The emission estimates have varied considerably over the past 15 years and are not clearly converging to progressively more accurate and certain results. (2) The most recent emissions estimate accurately captures the rapid decrease in carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions, but overestimates the magnitude of CO emissions by about a factor of two. (3) The oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission estimates for the mid to late 1990s are reasonably accurate, but NOx emissions have increased through that decade rather than decreased as indicated in emission estimates. (4) The most recent emissions estimate more accurately apportions NOx emissions between diesel and gasoline fueled vehicles than did earlier reports. (5) The ratio of two specific VOC species that has been characterized by ambient measurements suggests that the inventory speciation of the VOCs is inaccurate by factors of 3–4. These tests lead to the derivation of “inferred emissions” for CO and NOx from the US on-road vehicle fleet that are consistent with all information used in these tests. Finally, it is shown that the international picture of US emissions has significant inaccuracies and inconsistencies.},

	abstract = {As the transportation sector undergoes three major transformations?electrification, shared/on-demand mobility, and automation?there are new challenges to analyzing the impacts of these trends on both the transportation system and the power sector. Most models that analyze the requirements of fleets of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) operate at the scale of an urban region, or smaller. A quadratically constrained, quadratic programming problem is formulated, designed to model the requirements of SAEVs at a national scale. The size of the SAEV fleet, the necessary charging infrastructure, the fleet charging schedule, and the dispatch required to serve demand for trips in a region are treated as decision variables. By minimizing both the amortized cost of the fleet and chargers as well as the operational costs of charging, it is possible to explore the coupled interactions between system design and operation. To apply the model at a national scale, key complications about fleet operations are simplified; but a detailed agent-based regional simulation model to parameterize those simplifications is leveraged. Preliminary results are presented, finding that all mobility in the United States (U.S.) currently served by 276 million personally owned vehicles could be served by 12.5 million SAEVs at a cost of \$ 0.27/vehicle-mile or \$ 0.18/passenger-mile. The energy requirements for this fleet would be 1142 GWh/day (8.5\% of 2017 U.S. electricity demand) and the peak charging load 76.7 GW (11\% of U.S. power peak). Several model sensitivities are explored, and it is found that sharing is a key factor in the analysis.},

	abstract = {The impending uptake of electric vehicles (EV) in worldwide car fleets is urging stakeholders to develop models that forecast impacts and risks of this transition. The most common modelling approaches rely on car movements provided in household travel surveys (HTS), despite their large data bias towards internal combustion engine vehicles. The scientific community has long wondered whether this characteristic of HTSs would undermine the conclusions drawn for EV mobility. This work applies state-of-the-art modelling techniques to the Swiss national HTS to conclusively prove, by means of validation, the reliability of these commonly used approaches. The cars tracked in the survey are converted to EVs, either pure battery or plug-in hybrids, and their performance is simulated over 4 consecutive days randomly sampled from the survey. EVs are allowed to charge at both residential and public locations at an adjustable charging power. Charging events are determined by a finely calibrated plugging-in decision scheme that depends on the battery’s state of charge. The resulting charging loads corroborate the validation, as these successfully compare with measurements obtained from several EV field tests. In addition, the study includes a sensitivity analysis that highlights the importance of accurately modelling various input parameters, especially EVs’ battery sizes and charging power. This work provides evidence that conventional HTSs are an appropriate instrument for generating EV insights, yet it adds guidelines to avoid modelling pitfalls and to maximise the simulation accuracy.},

However, empirical evidence on which vehicle electrifies more mileage with a given battery capacity is lacking. Here, we present the first systematic overview of empirical findings on actual PHEV and BEV usage for the US and Germany. Contrary to common belief, PHEV with about 60 km of real-world range currently electrify as many annual vehicles kilometres as BEV with a much smaller battery. Accordingly, PHEV recharged from renewable electricity can highly contribute to green house gas mitigation in car transport. Including the higher CO2eq emissions during the production phase of BEV compared to PHEV, PHEV show today higher CO2eq savings then BEVs compared to conventional vehicles. However, for significant CO2eq improvements of PHEV and particularly of BEVs the decarbonisation of the electricity system should go on.},

	abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) are known as the future vehicles that have the potential to provide environmental benefits all over the world. The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of EVs have already been estimated for each phase in the life cycle. However, the dedicated estimations in China are not complete enough to reveal the systematic impacts of real manufacturing technologies, driving cycle and recycling processes. This study has analyzed the GHG emissions of the Cradle-to-Gate (CTG) phase, Well-to-Wheel (WTW) phase and Grave-to-Cradle (GTC) phase for different vehicles in different time to figure out the key drivers and reduction opportunities, which are based on the well-selling A0-A class compact sedan model currently in China. The results indicate that the life cycle GHG emissions of an EV are about 41.0 t CO2eq in 2015, 18\% lower than those of an Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle (ICEV). This value will decrease to only 34.1 t CO2eq in 2020 due to the reduction of GHG emission factor of electricity. Although the WTW phase is the largest contributor of GHG emissions for both vehicles, the proportions of each phase are quite different. The GHG emissions of the WTW phase of an EV are decreasing rapidly, but the CTG phase will not be improved at the same speed, which may become a barrier to fully take the environmental benefits of an EV. There are two major opportunities for reduction in the entire life cycle besides fuel economy development. One is EV recycling that can reduce the GHG emissions of the CTG phase by about a half. The other is the improvement of clean power grid that can further reduce the GHG emissions of the WTW phase.},

Concerns about the ability of electric vehicles to provide the same level of service as gasoline vehicles has been overstated: we found no statistical difference between the two technologies for services provided to ride-hailing companies.

The total cost of each energy system is calculated, both with and without externalities, to find the least cost energy systems. Using today’s costs of conventional and renewable electricity and without adding any externalities, the cost-minimum system includes no renewable generation, but does include EVs. When externalities are included, however, the most cost-effective to system covers 50\% of the electric load with renewable energy and runs reliably without need for either new conventional generation or purpose-built storage. The three novel energy policy implications of this research are: (1) using today’s cost of renewable electricity and estimates of externalities, it is cost effective to implement 240GW of renewable electricity to meet 50\% of the total electric load; (2) there is limited need to construct new natural gas power plants, especially from a system-wide perspective; and (3) existing coal plants may still be useful to the energy system, and instead of being retired, should be repurposed to occasionally provide generation.},

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) policies provide additional economic incentives. This analysis evaluates the costs and benefits associated with the use of electric vehicles and determines the cost effectiveness of using a V2G-capable electric school bus compared to a traditional diesel school bus. Several factors were analyzed, including fuel expense, electricity and battery costs, health externalities, and frequency regulation market price. The V2G-capable electric bus provides the school savings of \$6070 per seat in net present value and becomes a net present benefit after five years of operation. Without externalities, the net present benefit would be \$5700 per seat. If the entire school district’s fleet switched to V2G-capable electric buses, the net present savings would be upwards of \$38 million. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine how the factors influenced the costs and benefits. In all cases, purchasing an electric school bus is consistently a net present benefit. Policies could be set into place to incentivize public school adoption of electric buses, encourage more efficient batteries, and develop V2G capabilities.},

The grid is equipped with small-scale charging stations rather than one large-scale charging station. In addition, photovoltaic solar panels are installed on the grid to gain renewable energy benefits. The electric vehicles operate on vehicle-to-grid mode. The charging and discharging behavior of all the electric vehicles on all buses is optimized by the given method. The presented strategy optimizes the electric vehicles operation to damp out the renewable energy intermittency and energy cost reduction at the same time. And, it minimizes the charging-discharging cycles of the vehicles batteries in order to avoid battery degradation. The proposed problem is modeled as nonlinear stochastic programming including uncertainty of solar energy and solved by GAMS software. The results demonstrate that the suggested method can properly charge and discharge the vehicle-to-grid system. The vehicles are often charged on off-peak low-cost time periods and they are discharged at on-peak high-cost time-intervals. The Intermittency of solar cells is dealt with the achieved charging-discharging pattern for vehicle-to-grid system and cost of consumed energy is minimized by energy shifting. The results validate that the presented strategy can efficaciously achieve all the intended purposes at the same time.},

	abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles are the currently favoured option to decarbonize the passenger car sector. However, a decarbonisation is only possible with electricity from renewable energies and plug-in electric vehicles might cause peak loads if they started to charge at the same time. Both these issues could be solved with coordinated load shifting (demand response). Previous studies analyzed this research question by focusing on private vehicles with domestic and work charging infrastructure. This study additionally includes the important early adopter group of commercial fleet vehicles and reflects the impact of domestic, commercial, work and public charging. For this purpose, two models are combined. In a comparison of three scenarios, we find that charging of commercial vehicles does not inflict evening load peaks in the same magnitude as purely domestic charging of private cars does. Also for private cars, charging at work occurs during the day and may reduce the necessity of load shifting while public charging plays a less important role in total charging demand as well as load shifting potential. Nonetheless, demand response reduces the system load by about 2.2 GW or 2.8\% when domestic and work charging are considered compared to a scenario with only domestic charging.},

At the same time, renewable energy can be used for a microgrid nearby, or incorporated into a large grid, to effectively address the volatility of renewable energy sources. Motivated by the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) and the randomness of renewable energy output, this paper proposes an effective strategy to improve the security and economy of the microgrid system. The uncertainty of wind power and EV’s state of charge (SOC) is modeled as uncertainty prediction sets. And considering the worst-case scenario, this proposed strategy can increase the absorption ratio of renewable energy while orderly guiding the charging and discharging of EVs in peak-load reduction and valley filling and thus, lower operating costs under various practical constraints. To solve the problem of over-conservatism of the robust optimization, this paper introduces a dispatch interval coefficient to adjust the degree of conservatism, while improving the economy of microgrids system. The robustness and feasibility of the proposed dispatch strategy are demonstrated by numerical case studies.},

However, large-scale implementation faces two major problems: (1) we must replace oil in the transportation sector, and (2) since today's inexpensive and abundant renewable energy resources have fluctuating output, to increase the fraction of electricity from them, we must learn to maintain a balance between demand and supply. Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) could reduce or eliminate oil for the light vehicle fleet. Adding “vehicle-to-grid” (V2G) technology to EVs can provide storage, matching the time of generation to time of load. Two national energy systems are modelled, one for Denmark, including combined heat and power (CHP) and the other a similarly sized country without CHP (the latter being more typical of other industrialized countries). The model (EnergyPLAN) integrates energy for electricity, transport and heat, includes hourly fluctuations in human needs and the environment (wind resource and weather-driven need for heat). Four types of vehicle fleets are modelled, under levels of wind penetration varying from 0\% to 100\%. EVs were assumed to have high power (10kW) connections, which provide important flexibility in time and duration of charging. We find that adding EVs and V2G to these national energy systems allows integration of much higher levels of wind electricity without excess electric production, and also greatly reduces national CO2 emissions.},

However, because of the complex nature of power systems, adding energy storage-based reserves to the power system may not necessarily benefit the environment. In this paper, we analyze these impacts in a test system and identify important drivers that affect the environmental outcomes. Dispatch results are obtained by solving an optimal power flow (OPF) problem and are used to determine emissions. We find that the impacts of adding energy storage are highly case-dependent. In systems with high renewable penetration levels and significant renewable curtailment, adding energy storage reduces emissions; in other systems, the impacts on emissions could be positive, neutral, or negative. The analyses presented in this paper show that policies to procure energy storage as a means to reduce emissions may actually lead to increased system-wide emissions if current dispatch algorithms are used. We also explore the impacts of modifying the dispatch algorithm to ensure system emissions with energy storage are no worse than system emissions without energy storage.},

	abstract = {Generation scheduling decision-making of power systems with renewable energy and energy storage (ES) is a multistage stochastic programming problem in nature, in which unit commitment (UC) decisions have to be made one day ahead before uncertainties are revealed, and hourly economic dispatch (ED) decisions are successively determined when real uncertainty realizations are observed gradually (i.e., nonanticipativity). To this end, inappropriate ED decisions at current hour may cause infeasibility of future ED decisions (i.e., robustness). Thus, how to properly schedule thermal unit outputs and ES charging/ discharging power against uncertainties becomes an important and urgent issue. In this paper, two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) methods are proposed to solve the scheduling problem of thermal units and ESs with uncertainties while ensuring solution robustness and nonanticipativity: explicit and implicit decision methods. Specifically, explicit decision method directly assumes affine policies between decision variables and uncertainty realizations; implicit decision method explores safe ranges of thermal unit outputs and ES state-of-charge (SOC) levels to guarantees feasibility of future ED solutions. Both methods can guarantee the nonanticipativity and robustness of multistage solutions. Numerical tests illustrate effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {The decarbonization policies implemented around the world have led to an ever-increasing penetration of variable Renewable Energy Sources (RES) posing new challenges to modern power systems in terms of adequacy and operational security. Flexibility has emerged as key concept in this new reality, albeit it remains without a universally agreed definition or a concrete assessment framework. This chapter contributes in filling this gap, presenting a step-wise methodological framework for assessing power system flexibility. It combines preliminary model independent analyses with simulations based on a Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch (UCED) model, representing the sequence of Day-Ahead, Intraday and Balancing Markets, along with System’s operational constraints such as Reserve requirements. Monte-Carlo simulations are employed for capturing the effects of RES and load variability, different hydro conditions, and contingencies in generating assets. A discussion on some key modeling challenges, such as of storage, Demand Response (DR), level of aggregation of generating units, maintenance requirements, and temperature dependency of demand is also provided. The main focus of the work is on the development of an appropriate set of indicators in order to infer meaningful information on power system flexibility needs, challenges, available resources and potential solutions. The developed framework sets a basis for resolving widespread misconceptions such as the non-availability of energy versus the non-availability of adequate level of reserves, or the lack of generating capacity versus the lack of flexibility resources. It also goes beyond traditional adequacy indicators, such as Expected Energy Not Served (EENS) and Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) in two main streams. First, indicators are developed to gain insights on potential undesired effects in the behavior of power markets, such as the probability of negative prices or high price volatility. Second, the probability of RES curtailment resulting from inadequate flexibility in the power system is assessed. Both can be significant to regulators and market operators, e.g. for developing new market products aiming at enhancing the provision of flexibility, and/or policy makers for assessing the capability of contemporary market architectures to drive the long-term policy goals regarding decarbonization. Finally, the methodological interrelations between flexibility studies and operational security assessments, such as stability analyses, are briefly discussed. Areas of improvement of the presented model are identified, while future challenges in flexibility assessments are qualitatively presented in the context of further decarbonization and decentralization of the power systems, including sector coupling, sectoral integration, modeling of electro-mobility, and peer-to-peer transaction schemes.},

Most technology policy initiates are at the national level and are predominantly concerned with levels of funding. This is a problem because high-tech industrial development is observed to be regional in nature and national technology policies do not explicitly pursue regional goals. This paper tests two hypotheses. First, that the different explicit and implicit technology policies have had a significant, although unintended, impact on the development of a special type of space, the high-tech regions. Next, that the spatial effects of government technology policy promote high-tech regions over other regions, although this influence is primarily of an implicit or unintended nature.},

First, traditional approaches to technology include those found in models of regional growth, in analyses of innovation diffusion, and in economic analysis of technological change. Second, recent research on regional development has involved technology from two perspectives—that of regional economic structure and that of innovation in the strategies and management of large corporations. Third, the underdevelopment of Third World countries has been attributed in part to technological dependence. The possibilities are abundant for research that would add to current understanding of regional development in an age of rapid technological change.},

Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3.In an early review of the Model S, Consumer Reports declared, "This car performs better than anything we've ever tested before.  Let me repeat that: Not just the best electric car, but the best car. It does just about everything really, really well." In 2019, Motor Trend named the 2013 Tesla Model S the ultimate "Car of the Year" over the magazine's entire 70-year history. It received a refresh in June 2021.},

Using tools from the mathematics of complementarity, this paper offers a simple yet unifying perspective on the fundamental forces that shape comparative advantage. The main results characterize sufficient conditions on factor productivity and factor supply to predict patterns of international specialization in a multifactor generalization of the Ricardian model which we refer to as an “elementary neoclassical economy.” These conditions, which hold for an arbitrarily large number of countries, goods, and factors, generalize and extend many results from the previous trade literature.

Using detailed data from the Netherlands between 1985 and 2019, the results show that tall wind turbines have considerably stronger effects on house prices, as compared to small turbines. For example, a tall turbine ({\textgreater}150m) decreases house prices within 2 km by 5.4\%, while a small turbine ({\textless}50m) has an effect of maximally 2\% and the effect dissipates after 1 km. Further results indicate that solar farms lead to a decrease in house prices within 1 km of about 2.6\%. By comparing the overall impact on house prices, we show that the external effects of solar farms per unit of energy output are comparable to those of wind turbines. Thus, building solar farms instead of wind turbines does not seem to be a way to avoid the external effects of renewable energy production.},

	abstract = {Background
In the United States, male-to-male sexual transmission accounts for the greatest number of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses and a substantial number of sexually transmitted infections (STI) annually. However, the prevalence and annual incidence of HIV and other STIs among men who have sex with men (MSM) cannot be estimated in local contexts because demographic data on sexual behavior, particularly same-sex behavior, are not routinely collected by large-scale surveys that allow analysis at state, county, or finer levels, such as the US decennial census or the American Community Survey (ACS). Therefore, techniques for indirectly estimating population sizes of MSM are necessary to supply denominators for rates at various geographic levels.

Objective
Our objectives were to indirectly estimate MSM population sizes at the county level to incorporate recent data estimates and to aggregate county-level estimates to states and core-based statistical areas (CBSAs).

Methods
We used data from the ACS to calculate a weight for each county in the United States based on its relative proportion of households that were headed by a male who lived with a male partner, compared with the overall proportion among counties at the same level of urbanicity (ie, large central metropolitan county, large fringe metropolitan county, medium/small metropolitan county, or nonmetropolitan county). We then used this weight to adjust the urbanicity-stratified percentage of adult men who had sex with a man in the past year, according to estimates derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), for each county. We multiplied the weighted percentages by the number of adult men in each county to estimate its number of MSM, summing county-level estimates to create state- and CBSA-level estimates. Finally, we scaled our estimated MSM population sizes to a meta-analytic estimate of the percentage of US MSM in the past 5 years (3.9\%).

Results
We found that the percentage of MSM among adult men ranged from 1.5\% (Wyoming) to 6.0\% (Rhode Island) among states. Over one-quarter of MSM in the United States resided in 1 of 13 counties. Among counties with over 300,000 residents, the five highest county-level percentages of MSM were San Francisco County, California at 18.5\% (66,586/359,566); New York County, New York at 13.8\% (87,556/635,847); Denver County, Colorado at 10.5\% (25,465/243,002); Multnomah County, Oregon at 9.9\% (28,949/292,450); and Suffolk County, Massachusetts at 9.1\% (26,338/289,634). Although California (n=792,750) and Los Angeles County (n=251,521) had the largest MSM populations of states and counties, respectively, the New York City-Newark-Jersey City CBSA had the most MSM of all CBSAs (n=397,399).

Conclusions
We used a new method to generate small-area estimates of MSM populations, incorporating prior work, recent data, and urbanicity-specific parameters. We also used an imputation approach to estimate MSM in rural areas, where same-sex sexual behavior may be underreported. Our approach yielded estimates of MSM population sizes within states, counties, and metropolitan areas in the United States, which provide denominators for calculation of HIV and STI prevalence and incidence at those geographic levels.},

	abstract = {The procedures and the nature of “technologies” are suggested to be broadly similar to those which characterize “science”. In particular, there appear to be “technological paradigms” (or research programmes) performing a similar role to “scientific paradigms” (or research programmes). The model tries to account for both continuous changes and discontinuities in technological innovation. Continuous changes are often related to progress along a technological trajectory defined by a technological paradigm, while discontinuities are associated with the emergence of a new paradigm. One-directional explanations of the innovative process, and in particular those assuming “the market” as the prime mover, are inadequate to explain the emergence of new technological paradigms. The origin of the latter stems from the interplay between scientific advances, economic factors, institutional variables, and unsolved difficulties on established technological paths. The model tries to establish a sufficiently general framework which accounts for all these factors and to define the process of selection of new technological paradigms among a greater set of notionally possible ones. The history of a technology is contextual to the history of the industrial structures associated with that technology. The emergence of a new paradigm is often related to new “schumpeterian” companies, while its establishment often shows also a process of oligopolistic stabilization.},

Researchers have started to evaluate the costs and benefits of flood adaptation, but information regarding the cost of different flood adaptation measures is often not available or is hidden in non-peer-reviewed literature. Recent review studies have explored cost estimates for different aspects of flood adaptation, such as nature-based solutions. This study aims to contribute empirical data regarding the cost of flood adaptation by compiling peer-reviewed literature and research reports. The focus is on construction costs and expenses for operation and maintenance. This paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016). Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.},

	abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to synergize with low or even zero-carbon electricity towards a deep mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and ultimately carbon neutrality. These benefits are only obtainable when EV charging maximizes the consumption of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. However, the current mismatch between renewable energy output and EV charging demand poses a substantial challenge. Rescheduling charging events, namely charging coordination, has the potential to integrate renewable electricity and tap into higher GHG emission reductions. In this study, with Beijing as the research domain, we develop a charging demand model informed by real-world usage data generated by a massive fleet of private cars, and evaluate the comprehensive impacts of various charging coordination schemes in the future with higher adoption rates of both private EVs and renewable power sources. The research finds that strategies aiming at maximizing renewable power consumption, netload valley filling, and charging cost minimization have similar climate benefits, which can reduce well-to-wheels GHG emissions by approximately 20\%, cut charging cost by half, and erase 95\% of the need for newly installed generation capacity compared to the benchmark scenario without coordinated charging. On the other hand, conventional charging strategies, such as the simple demand-valley-filling strategy, would increase GHG emissions. The study indicates that substantial benefits can be synergistically achieved between power and transport systems towards improved grid stability, lower fuel cost, and greater emission mitigation by leveraging EV charging flexibility at the end-user side (i.e., charging facility). Furthermore, the potential need for sophisticated charging coordination with multiple optimization objectives is brought to attention.},

	abstract = {Numerous analyses of the benefits and costs of COVID‐19 policies have been completed quickly as the crisis has unfolded. The results often largely depend on the approach used to value mortality risk reductions, typically expressed as the value per statistical life (VSL). Many analyses rely on a population‐average VSL estimate; some adjust VSL for life expectancy at the age of death. We explore the implications of theory and empirical studies, which suggest that the relationship between age and VSL is uncertain. We compare the effects of three approaches: (1) an invariant population‐average VSL; (2) a constant value per statistical life‐year (VSLY); and (3) a VSL that follows an inverse‐U pattern, peaking in middle age. We find that when applied to the U.S. age distribution of COVID‐19 deaths, these approaches result in average VSL estimates of \$10.63 million, \$4.47 million, and \$8.31 million. We explore the extent to which applying these estimates alters the conclusions of frequently cited analyses of social distancing, finding that they significantly affect the findings. However, these analyses do not address other characteristics of COVID‐19 deaths that may increase or decrease the VSL estimates. Examples include the health status and income level of those affected, the size of the risk change, and the extent to which the risk is dreaded, uncertain, involuntarily incurred, and outside of one's control. The effects of these characteristics and their correlation with age are uncertain; it is unclear whether they amplify or diminish the effects of age on VSL.},

	abstract = {I present a multi-impact economic valuation framework called the Social Cost of Atmospheric Release (SCAR) that extends the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) used previously for carbon dioxide (CO2) to a broader range of pollutants and impacts. Values consistently incorporate health impacts of air quality along with climate damages. The latter include damages associated with aerosol-induced hydrologic cycle changes that lead to net climate benefits when reducing cooling aerosols. Evaluating a 1 \% reduction in current global emissions, benefits with a high discount rate are greatest for reductions of co-emitted products of incomplete combustion (PIC), followed by sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and then CO2, ammonia and methane. With a low discount rate, benefits are greatest for PIC, with CO2 and SO2 next, followed by NOx and methane. These results suggest that efforts to mitigate atmosphere-related environmental damages should target a broad set of emissions including CO2, methane and aerosol/ozone precursors. Illustrative calculations indicate environmental damages are \$330-970 billion yr−1 for current US electricity generation ({\textasciitilde}14–34¢ per kWh for coal, {\textasciitilde}4–18¢ for gas) and \$3.80 (−1.80/+2.10) per gallon of gasoline (\$4.80 (−3.10/+3.50) per gallon for diesel). These results suggest that total atmosphere-related environmental damages plus generation costs are much greater for coal-fired power than other types of electricity generation, and that damages associated with gasoline vehicles substantially exceed those for electric vehicles.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide is suspected to be a major contributor to global warming. In the United States, nearly 70\% of electricity is produced using coal or natural gas, both of which emit carbon dioxide into the environment. Nuclear power, which does not emit any carbon dioxide, produces 17\% of the electricity consumed in the United States. In order to persuade utilities to switch from coal or natural gas to nuclear power and thus reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a carbon tax should be implemented. Depending on the cost of construction for new nuclear plants and the level of savings that will incentivize utilities to switch, the carbon tax needed to promote nuclear power will range between \$20/tC and \$200/tC. The full range of carbon tax scenarios are developed in this thesis, with the most likely carbon tax being \$1 10/tC. This cost assumes a \$1800/kw capital construction cost and a 10\% risk perception premium on the bus bar cost of power to address the financial and industry community's somewhat negative perception of nuclear investments. From a policy perspective, this carbon tax will be more effective in causing utilities to move to nuclear power than a cap and trade policy. From a utility standpoint, switching to nuclear power under a carbon tax is less expensive than implementing a program of carbon capture and sequestration.},

In France, nuclear is the first contributor to today's low-carbon power mix and it will, tomorrow, be challenged by the increase of variable renewable energy sources. This paper develops a prospective approach to examine the solicitations that nuclear will have to face, for several scenarios. Results show that, with the penetration of renewable energy sources, the number of extreme nuclear power ramps and amplitudes variations increase, as well as the number of annually required shut-downs/start-ups events per reactor, even if the nuclear capacity was to be lowered. Beyond 30\% wind and solar penetration, complementary flexibility options will have to be leveraged.},

Renewable energy sources are not continuous, dependent upon geographical location as well as climatic conditions, and require a very large land footprint. Future of nuclear energy is also uncertain because of public apprehensions and subsequent government policies. To overcome the issues derailing these two virtually carbon-free energy sources, a new hybrid or integrated nuclear-renewable energy system is being proposed and seen as an attractive option. Such integrated energy systems are conceived as a nuclear power reactor coupled with renewable energy generation and industrial processes that may simultaneously tackle the concerns regarding grid flexibility, climate change, energy security, optimal return on invested capital, and settling public concerns. Apart from highlighting the key challenges associated with nuclear energy and renewable energy sources while operating as an independent power generation system, the present paper delineates the various aspects associated with integrated nuclear-renewable energy systems. It may be speculated that integrating nuclear energy and renewable energy into a single hybrid energy system, coupled through informatics linkages, would enable to overcome the demerits present when they operate individual.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants are commonly operated in a “baseload” mode at maximum rated capacity whenever online. However, nuclear power plants are technically capable of flexible operation, including changing power output over time (ramping or load following) and providing frequency regulation and operating reserves. At the same time, flexibility is becoming more valuable as many regions transition to low-carbon power systems with higher shares of variable renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power. We present a novel mixed integer linear programming formulation to more accurately represent the distinct technical operating constraints of nuclear power stations, including impacts of xenon transients in the reactor core and changing core reactivity over the fuel irradiation cycle. This novel representation of nuclear flexibility is integrated into a unit commitment and economic dispatch model for the power system. In a case study using representative utility data from the Southwest United States, we investigate the potential impacts of flexible nuclear operations in a power system with significant solar and wind energy penetration. We find that flexible nuclear operation lowers power system operating costs, increases reactor owner revenues, and substantially reduces curtailment of renewables.},

To support future decisions on the deployment of this technology, society requires better estimates of its environmental impacts and limitations. As solar geoengineering has never been deployed, conclusions about its climatic effects are primarily obtained through models and natural analogues. As such, our confidence in projections of solar geoengineering, the basis for that confidence and how our confidence can be improved is limited. In this Perspective, we review our current understanding of uncertainty and risk in solar geoengineering via stratospheric aerosols. Using a risk-register framework, we illustrate key uncertainties, such as sub-grid-scale mixing or effects of stratospheric heating, investigations of which should be prioritized to transition the field to a mission-driven research agenda. We conclude with recommendations for possible avenues of research, including targeted model intercomparisons and appropriately governed small-scale field experiments.},

Aside from their sea-level location, they are both characterized by large populations, valuable infrastructure and real estate, and economic dependence on tourism, as well as the availability of advanced scientiﬁc data and technological expertize. Yet their responses have been quite different. We examine the biophysical environments of the two cities, as well as their socioeconomic features, administrative arrangements vulnerabilities, and responses to sea level rise and ﬂooding. Our study uses a qualitative approach to illustrate how adaptation policies have emerged in these two coastal cities. Based on this information, we critically compare the different adaptive responses of Venice and Miami and suggest what each city may learn from the other, as well as offer lessons for other vulnerable coastal cities. In the two cases presented here it would seem that adaptation to SLR has not yet led to a reformulation of the problem or a structural transformation of the relevant institutions. Decision-makers must address the complex issue of rising seas with a combination of scientiﬁc knowledge, socio-economic expertize, and good governance. In this regard, the “hi-tech” approach of Venice has generated problems of its own (as did the ﬂood control projects in South Florida over half a century ago), while the increasing public mobilization in Miami appears more promising. The importance of continued long-term adaptation measures is essential in both cities.},

Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2–4.6\% of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25–123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3–9.3\% of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US\$ 12–71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

	abstract = {Faced with sea level rise and the intensification of extreme events, human populations living on the coasts are developing responses to address local situations. A synthesis of the literature on responses to coastal adaptation allows us to highlight different adaptation strategies. Here, we analyze these strategies according to the complexity of their implementation, both institutionally and technically. First, we distinguish two opposing paradigms – fighting against rising sea levels or adapting to new climatic conditions; and second, we observe the level of integrated management of the strategies. This typology allows a distinction between four archetypes with the most commonly associated governance modalities for each. We then underline the need for hybrid approaches and adaptation trajectories over time to take into account local socio-cultural, geographical, and climatic conditions as well as to integrate stakeholders in the design and implementation of responses. We show that dynamic and participatory policies can foster collective learning processes and enable the evolution of social values and behaviors. Finally, adaptation policies rely on knowledge and participatory engagement, multi-scalar governance, policy monitoring, and territorial solidarity. These conditions are especially relevant for densely populated areas that will be confronted with sea level rise, thus for coastal cities in particular.},

	abstract = {Wide deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) would greatly facilitate global de-carbonization, but achieving the emission targets depends on future battery prices. Conventional learning curves for manufacturing costs, used in many battery projections, unrealistically predict battery prices will fall below \$100/kWh by 2030, pushing EVs to hit price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in the absence of incentives. However, in reality, essential materials costs set practical lower bounds on battery prices. Our 2-stage learning curve model projects the active material costs and NMC-based Lithium-ion battery pack price with mineral and material costs as the respective price floors. The improved model predicts nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery prices will fall only to about \$124/kWh by 2030 – much cheaper than today, but still too expensive to truly compete with ICEVs, due primarily to the high prices of cobalt, nickel, and lithium. Our results suggest that stabilizing raw materials prices and/or stimulating R\&D activities on alternative battery chemistries will be important to achieve environmentally sustainable EV-based ground transportation at an attractive price.},

	abstract = {The aim of the model was to forecast the groundwater mercury pollution distribution aureole and to discuss the mathematical simulations of the estimated quantity of mercury entering the river Irtysh and the aquifer wells in the village of Pavlodarskoe.
During the years of 1975-1993, the industrial chemical plant activity, which consisted of caustic soda and chlorine production resulting from electrolysis of mercury at the cathode, has been the primary source of mercury pollution in groundwater at the site.  The mercury polluted groundwater was situated on the right shore of the river Irtysh and was located five kilometers from the chemical plant.  Approximately 1,000 tons of mercury has been collected over the years as a result of numerous spills at this chemical plant.
Groundwater aquifers at depths up to 20 meters were located within the boundaries of the area to be investigated.  The groundwater aquifers were represented by sand, layers of clay, sandy loams, and loams.
A mathematical model was developed for the groundwater mercury pollution process study.  This regional hydrodynamic model was used to forecast mercury pollution aureole distribution in the plan.  The solution to the three-dimensional mercury transfer problem was resolved on a local model by reproducing the lithological structure and evaluating the mercury sorption processes in the plan.
Groundwater mercury pollution aureole distribution was forecast for the next 30 years (2007-2037) using the local model.  The entry of mercury into the aquifer was localized during the planned prognostic task solution.
At the end of the prognostic task period, the area of the groundwater mercury pollution aureole in the sandy deposits would be considerably lower.  The aureole would be transferred approximately 200 meters in the north-north-western direction.  Entry of the mercury polluted waters into the drainage channel (located in the northern part of the region) is possible.
Based on the results of the mathematical simulations, the mercury transfer moved in the horizontal direction into the sandy layer between the clay layers and also in the vertical direction.  The mercury was also able to enter the aeration zone prior to moving through the vegetation and the superficial waters.
In this study, the territory investigated was where large quantities of mercury were deposited.  There is a high probability that the hydrogeological conditions of this area will change over time.  Therefore it is necessary to continue to observe the groundwater quality near this chemical plant. To use the mathematical model to forecast the groundwater mercury pollution distribution aureole and to discuss the mathematical simulations of the estimated quantity of mercury entering the river Irtysh and the aquifer wells in the village of Pavlodarskoe.},

The Order established a "regulatory philosophy" and several "principles for regulation," among them requirements to explicitly identify the problem to be addressed, determine whether existing regulations created or contributed to the problem, assess alternatives to direct regulation, and design regulations in the most cost-effective manner.  § 1(a) summarizes this regulatory philosophy as follows:

Federal agencies should promulgate only such regulations as are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by compelling public need, such as material failures of private markets to protect or improve the health and safety of the public, the environment, or the well-being of the American people.Agencies were directed to fulfill these requirements though economic analysis, most notably the preparation of Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs).  Regulations within this definition are colloquially termed "economically significant."},

A prevalent practice has been to report policy analysis with incredible certitude. That is, exact predictions of policy outcomes are routine, while expressions of uncertainty are rare. However, predictions and estimates often are fragile, resting on unsupported assumptions and limited data. Therefore, the expressed certitude is not credible. This paper summarizes my work documenting incredible certitude and calling for transparent communication of uncertainty.

It is beset by theological disputations over free will, by the dilemmas of absurdism, by the doubts of psychological behaviorism, by the claims of historical, economic, social, and demographic determinism. The tools of intelligence as they are fashioned in modern theories of choice are necessary to any reasonable behavior in contemporary society. The argument that goal development and choice are independent behaviorally seems clearly false. It seems to me perfectly obvious that a description that assumes goals come first and action comes later is frequently radically wrong. The result is that many of the most influential, best educated, and best placed citizens have experienced a powerful overlearning with respect to rationality. Contemporary theories of decision making and the technology of reason have considerably strengthened our capabilities for effective social action.},

In contrast, we find that dieters do not simply adopt the red, yellow, and green cues into their health quality evaluations. Instead, regardless of the color, the TLC approach increases the depth at which dieters process label information. Dieters tend to focus on the costs of consumption and, as a result, lower their health quality evaluations.

	abstract = {Electric power systems with substantial wind capacity require additional flexibility to react to rapid changes in wind farm output and mismatches in the timing of generation and demand. Controlled variable-rate charging of plug-in electric vehicles allows demand to be rapidly modulated, providing an alternative to using fast-responding natural gas plants for balancing supply with demand and potentially reducing costs of operation and new plant construction. We investigate the cost savings from controlled charging of electric vehicles, the extent to which these benefits increase in high wind penetration scenarios, and the trade-off between establishing a controlled charging program vs. increasing the capacity of generators in the power system. We construct a mixed integer linear programming model for capacity expansion, plant dispatch, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging based on the NYISO system. We find that controlled charging cuts the cost of integrating PHEVs in half. The magnitude of these savings is ∼5\% to 15\% higher in a system with 20\% wind penetration compared to a system with no wind power, and the savings are 50–60\% higher in a system that requires capacity expansion.},

Early attempts to reduce decision biases with training met with little success, leading scientists and policy makers to focus on debiasing by using incentives and changes in the presentation and elicitation of decisions. We report the results of two longitudinal experiments that found medium to large effects of one-shot debiasing training interventions. Participants received a single training intervention, played a computer game or watched an instructional video, which addressed biases critical to intelligence analysis (in Experiment 1: bias blind spot, confirmation bias, and fundamental attribution error; in Experiment 2: anchoring, representativeness, and social projection). Both kinds of interventions produced medium to large debiasing effects immediately (games ≥ −31.94\% and videos ≥ −18.60\%) that persisted at least 2 months later (games ≥ −23.57\% and videos ≥ −19.20\%). Games that provided personalized feedback and practice produced larger effects than did videos. Debiasing effects were domain general: bias reduction occurred across problems in different contexts, and problem formats that were taught and not taught in the interventions. The results suggest that a single training intervention can improve decision making. We suggest its use alongside improved incentives, information presentation, and nudges to reduce costly errors associated with biased judgments and decisions.},

This strategy outlined China’s aims to become the world leader in AI by 2030, to monetise AI into a trillion-yuan (ca. 150 billion dollars) industry, and to emerge as the driving force in defining ethical norms and standards for AI. Several reports have analysed specific aspects of China’s AI policies or have assessed the country’s technical capabilities. Instead, in this article, we focus on the socio-political background and policy debates that are shaping China’s AI strategy. In particular, we analyse the main strategic areas in which China is investing in AI and the concurrent ethical debates that are delimiting its use. By focusing on the policy backdrop, we seek to provide a more comprehensive and critical understanding of China’s AI policy by bringing together debates and analyses of a wide array of policy documents.},

Focusing on classics that contributed significantly to the field over the second half of the 20th century, it offers insights into works that have explored aspects of the policy process, of particular features of bureaucracy, and of administrative and policy reforms. Each classic is discussed by a leading international scholars. They offer unique insights into the ways in which individual classics have been received in scholarly debates and disciplines, how classics have shaped evolving research agendas, and how the individual classics continue to shape contemporary scholarly debates. In doing so, this volume offers a novel approach towards considering the various central contributions to the field.

Using Beijing as a case study, this article examines the extent to which neighborhood-scale urban form may contribute to reduction of travel-related CO2 emissions in the context of rapid urbanization and spatial transformation. We derive complete travel-activity records of 1,048 residents from an activity diary survey conducted in 2007. Analysis using structural equation models finds that residents living in a neighborhood with higher land use mix, public transit accessibility, and more pedestrian-friendly street design tend to travel in a “low-carbon” manner and emit less CO2 in daily travel, even controlling for residential and travel preferences. This article offers empirical evidence that sheds light on debates about policy measures to facilitate China’s transition toward sustainable and low-carbon urban development.},

Urban planning is a critical element, as it allows a greater level of public transport usage, walking and cycling, and more localised trip patterns. Two case studies are examined, in London and Oxfordshire, and future strategies for urban form and transport investment strategies are developed showing the possibilities at various scales.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to assess and gain a deeper understanding of the role of service quality in sustainable mobility. Specifically, the study aims to understand user perceptions related to service quality in urban public transport systems and to investigate whether they induce the adoption of adopt more sustainable behaviours for mobility purposes by opting for alternative means of transportation such as car-sharing, bike-sharing, and car-pooling instead of using one's own private car. Indeed, it is becoming vital for cities to investigate the norm of owning a car as a solution and to break this norm to allow citizens to stop using their car as an environmentally friendly solution. On the basis of the above theoretical assumptions, we develop a theoretical framework that aims to fill the literature gaps and is therefore oriented towards understand the linkage among the service quality of the urban public transportation system, service loyalty to urban public transport, the intention to use one's own private car less, and the intention to use sustainable means of transportation, mainly car-sharing. An empirical investigation involving the city of Rome, Italy, is performed. The study proposes a territorial analysis and a qualitative and quantitative survey. The aim of this empirical study is two-fold: i) to learn the state of the art of the urban public transport system of the city under investigation and ii) to explore citizens' perceptions of the service quality of public transport and to understand their intentions to use public transport more, to use their own cars less and to adopt sustainable means of transportation such as car-sharing. PLS-PM statistical tools are used for data analysis. Our findings confirm that service quality has a direct effect on the intention to use public transport more and that this effect affects both the intention to use one's own car less and the intention to use sustainable means of transportation such as car-sharing more.},

On the basis of data from 370 US urbanized areas and using structural equation modeling, population densities are shown to be strongly and positively associated with VMT per capita (direct effect elasticity = ⊟0.604); however, this effect is moderated by the traffic-inducing effects of denser urban settings having denser road networks and better local-retail accessibility (indirect effect elasticity = 0.223, yielding a net effect elasticity = ⊟0.381). Accessibility to basic employment has comparatively modest effects, as do size of urbanized area, and rail-transit supplies and usage. Nevertheless, urban planning and city design should be part of any strategic effort to shrink the environmental footprint of the urban transportation sector.},

	abstract = {Consider the problem of modelling memory effects in discrete-state random walks using higher-order Markov chains. This paper explores cross-validation and information criteria as proxies for a model’s predictive accuracy. Our objective is to select, from data, the number of prior states of recent history upon which a trajectory is statistically dependent. Through simulations, I evaluate these criteria in the case where data are drawn from systems with fixed orders of history, noting trends in the relative performance of the criteria. As a real-world illustrative example of these methods, this manuscript evaluates the problem of detecting statistical dependencies in shot outcomes in free throw shooting. Over three National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons analysed, several players exhibited statistical dependencies in free throw hitting probability of various types—hot handedness, cold handedness and error correction. For the 2013–2014 to 2015–2016 NBA seasons, I detected statistical dependencies in 23\% of all player-seasons. Focusing on a single player, in two of these three seasons, LeBron James shot a better percentage after an immediate miss than otherwise. Conditioning on the previous outcome makes for a more-predictive model than treating free throw makes as independent. When extended specifically to LeBron James' 2016–2017 season, a model depending on the previous shot (single-step Markovian) does not clearly beat a model with independent outcomes. An error-correcting variable length model of two parameters, where James shoots a higher percentage after a missed free throw than otherwise, is more predictive than either model.},

	abstract = {The value of a statistical life (VSL) is the local tradeoff rate between fatality risk and money. When the tradeoff values are derived from choices in market contexts the VSL serves as both a measure of the population’s willingness to pay for risk reduction and the marginal cost of enhancing safety. Given its fundamental economic role, policy analysts have adopted the VSL as the economically correct measure of the benefit individuals receive from enhancements to their health and safety. Estimates of the VSL for the United States are around \$10 million (\$2017), and estimates for other countries are generally lower given the positive income elasticity of the VSL. Because of the prominence of mortality risk reductions as the justification for government policies the VSL is a crucial component of the benefit-cost analyses that are part of the regulatory process in the United States and other countries. The VSL is also foundationally related to the concepts of value of a statistical life year (VSLY) and value of a statistical injury (VSI), which also permeate the labor and health economics literatures. Thus, the same types of valuation approaches can be used to monetize non-fatal injuries and mortality risks that pose very small effects on life expectancy. In addition to formalizing the concept and measurement of the VSL and presenting representative estimates for the United States and other countries our Encyclopedia selection addresses the most important questions concerning the nuances that are of interest to researchers and policymakers.},

Bentham proposed the law of escheat and a tax on bankers' and stock dealers' profits, subject to the principle of least sacrifice of enjoyment. He also planned to correct the inequality of the land tax by extending it into a general income tax. Mill proposed an income tax on the basis of the principle of equal sacrifice of enjoyment. He also proposed a progressive inheritance tax and a variable land tax, regarding unearned income as a fit subject for a special tax. Consequently, Mill used Bentham's ideas and tools to take a step towards a more egalitarian programme.},

to identify effective tools that increase college students' ability to tolerate and positively cope with stress.
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of physical activity associated behaviors and exercise types significantly associated with high stress tolerance
(HST) among college students.
Methods: Research design employed was an quantitative, analytical, cross-sectional study of randomly selected college students (N=936) that completed a stress tolerance questionnaire (STQ) coupled with a physical activity log. Statistical differences
by type of physical activity and stress tolerance were determined by Chi-Square and Odds Ratio (95\%CI).
Results: Significant physical activity behaviors associated with HST included: exercised (p=0.001), engaged in leisure activity (p=0.004), engaged in extra-curricular activity
(p=0.012), and engaged in extra-curricular sport (p=0.039). Three out of four types exercise were significantly associated with HST: vigorous exercise, stretching, and resistance training (p{\textless}0.05).
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the positive protective impact of physical
activity behaviors and exercise on stress tolerance among college students.},

The construct recognizes four aspects of controllability: personal control of outcomes, shared control of outcomes, others in responsibility, and uncontrollable/unpredictable outcomes. Lacking a suitable measurement instrument, the Controllability Awareness Inventory (CAI) was developed and used to assess controllability awareness as a characteristic of stress tolerance. Results indicate that individuals with a greater tendency to respond based on an awareness of the controllability of potential outcomes perceive their lives as less stressful, report themselves to be in better health, and think in ways that enable them to manage environmental demands more effectively. Controllability awareness training to help reduce perceived stress and promote health is discussed.},

	abstract = {The challenge to mitigate real-world emissions from vehicles calls for powerful in-use compliance supervision. The remote on-board diagnostic (OBD) approach, with wireless data communications, is one of the promising next-generation monitoring methods. We collected second-by-second profiles of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions, driving conditions and engine performance for three conventional diesel and three hybrid diesel buses participating in a remote OBD pilot program in Nanjing, China. Our results showed that the average CO2 emissions for conventional diesel and hybrid diesel buses were 816 ± 83 g km−1 and 627 ± 54 g km−1, respectively, under a typical driving pattern. An operating mode binning analysis indicated that CO2 emissions reduction by series-parallel hybrid technology was largely because of the significant benefits of the technology under the modes of low speed and low power demand. However, significantly higher CO2 emissions were observed for conventional diesel buses during rush hours, higher than 1200 g km−1. The OBD data suggested no improvement in NOX emission reduction for hybrid buses compared with conventional buses; both were approximately 12 g km−1 because of poor performance of the selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems in the real world. Speed-dependent functions for real-world CO2 and NOX emissions were also constructed. The CO2 emissions of hybrid buses were much less sensitive to the average speed than conventional buses. If the average speed decreased from 20 km h−1 to 10 km h−1, the estimated CO2 emission factor for conventional buses would be increased by 34\%. Such a change in speed would increase NOX emissions for conventional and hybrid buses by 38\% and 56\%, respectively. This paper demonstrates the useful features of the remote OBD system and can inform policy makers how to take advantage of these features in monitoring in-use vehicles.},

	shorttitle = {Angels},
	abstract = {The Book of Genesis depicts them as doing strange things--mating with the daughters of men to spawn giants, for example, and wrestling with Jacob for no apparent reason. In It's a Wonderful Life, Frank Capra spun a tale of one as a bumbling helper of humans; in Wings of Desire, Wim Wenders told of one who wished to be human. They are angels, of course, and they have fascinated us since recorded history began. In Angels, David Albert Jones provides a crisp, broad-ranging survey of angels in theology, philosophy, and popular culture. Focusing on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, he examines how angels have been imagined and explained, and why they continue to captivate us. Jones explores the classical discussion--what they are made of, when they came to be, how many there are, and whether anyone ever did ask how many could dance on the head of a pin. He names the archangels, surveys the different hierarchies, and examines how they have changed over time. Jones explains, for example, how cherubim became cherubs, and why angels in the Hebrew Bible are typically male, but in later art became androgynous, or even female by the twentieth century. The book explores the idea that Satan was a fallen angel (a belief not shared by Islam), and looks at demons and exorcism. But Jones concentrates on good angels, in their roles as messengers, guardians, or helpers. He looks at why the idea of angels remains so attractive, and so potent in modern culture--even among nonbelievers.From scripture to cinema, Jones offers a sweeping, accessible introduction to this remarkable phenomenon. Whether we believe in angels or not, he argues, the study of their role in cultures past and present can teach us much about humanity.},

	abstract = {Users charging the batteries of their electric vehicles in an uncoordinated manner can present energy systems with a challenge. One possible solution, smart charging, relies on the flexibility within each charging process and controls the charging process to optimize different objectives. Effective smart charging requires forecasts of energy requirements and parking duration at the charging station for each individual charging process. We use data from travel logs to create quantile forecasts of parking duration and energy requirements, approximated by upcoming trip distance. For this task, we apply quantile regression, multi-layer perceptrons with tilted loss function, and multivariate conditional kernel density estimators. The out-of-sample evaluation shows that the use of local information from the vehicle's travel data improves the forecasting accuracy by 13.7\% for parking duration and 0.56\% for trip distance compared to the data generated at the charging stations. In addition, the analysis of a case study shows that using probabilistic forecasts can control the interruption of charging processes more efficiently compared to point forecasts. Probabilistic forecasting leads up to 7.0\% less interruptions, which can cause a restriction in drivers' mobility demand. The results show that charging station operators benefit from leveraging the driving patterns of electric vehicles. Thereby, smart charging and the application of the proposed models as benchmarks models for the related forecasting tasks is an improvement for the operators.},

Charging these vehicles will add significant load to the electricity network, and it is important to understand the impact this will have on both the transmission and distribution level systems, and how smart charging can alleviate it. Here we analyse the effects that charging a large electric vehicle fleet would have on the power network, taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of vehicle use, electricity demand, and network structure. A conditional probability based method is used to model uncontrolled charging demand, and convex optimisation is used to model smart charging. Stochasticity is captured using Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that for Great Britain’s power system, smart charging can simultaneously eliminate the need for additional generation infrastructure required with 100\% electric vehicle adoption, while also reducing the percentage of distribution networks which would require reinforcement from 28\% to 9\%. Discussion is included as to how far these results can be extended to other power systems.},

A novel parametrization approach dealing with the weekday dependent variations of EV demand is introduced. Investigating a broad interval of CO2 prices yields robustness against varying merit order curves. The underlying nonlinear relationship leads to qualitatively different impacts of EVs on power plant dispatch at different CO2 prices. Furthermore, we find that curtailment of renewable energy sources is reduced independently of the charging strategy. Concerning system cost and emissions, the charging strategy vehicle-to-grid proves to be most beneficial. We show that at low CO2 prices, a production increase of emission intense technologies, such as lignite power plants is overcompensated by several other system components.},

	abstract = {The variation in BEV energy consumption and driving range under different weather and driving conditions can affect the usefulness and consumer acceptance of these vehicles. Thus, there is a need to better understand and quantify seasonal factors that affect consumption and range under real-world driving conditions. In this paper, a dataset representing the real-world driving activity of 197 BEVs of the same model recorded over 12 months at a polling frequency of 0.1 Hz is analyzed to estimate BEV performance across different driving applications (personal driving, taxi operation, and ridesharing) and seasons (spring/autumn, summer, and winter). The results show that the electricity consumption, travel patterns, and charging patterns of BEVs vary significantly by both vehicle application and season. For example, BEV models with a range of 160 km, recharged every 1.6 days on average, can meet most trip demands of personal vehicles. However, the same BEV model when used for ridesharing or taxi purposes, is driven much more and recharged more frequently. The results also show that actual BEV electricity consumption (EC) differs significantly from the consumption predicted by the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test, with real-world EC being 7\%–10\% higher than predicted by the NEDC test cycle. Furthermore, the real-world range of personal-use BEVs in winter is only 64\% of the NEDC-estimated range. The study found that, when the ambient temperature is lower than 10 °C, electricity consumption increases 2.4 kWh/100 km for every 5 °C decrease in temperature. When it is higher than 28 °C, EC increases 2.3 kWh/100 km for every 5 °C increase in temperature. These findings imply that manufacturers should design BEVs with application-appropriate driving ranges and make R\&D investments for improving battery performance in cold environments.},

	abstract = {Official laboratory-measured monitoring data indicate a progressive decline in the average fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of the European passenger car fleet. There is increasing evidence to suggest that officially reported CO2 values do not reflect the actual performance of the vehicles on the road. A reported difference of 30–40\% between official values and real-world estimates was found which has been continuously increasing. This paper reviews the influence of different factors that affect fuel consumption and CO2 emissions on the road and in the laboratory. Factors such as driving behaviour, vehicle configuration and traffic conditions are reconfirmed as highly influential. Neglected factors (e.g. side winds, rain, road grade), which may have significant contributions in fuel consumption in real world driving are identified. The margins of the present certification procedure contribute between 10 and 20\% in the gap between the reported values and reality. The latter was estimated to be of the order of 40\%, or 47.5gCO2/km for 2015 average fleet emissions, but could range up to 60\% or down to 19\% depending on prevailing traffic conditions. The introduction of a new test protocol is expected to bridge about half of the present divergence between laboratory and real world. Finally, substantial literature was found on the topic; however, the lack of common test procedures, analysis tools, and coordinated activity across different countries point out the need for additional research in order to support targeted actions for real world CO2 reduction. Quality checks of the CO2 certification procedure, and the reported values, combined with in-use consumption monitoring could be used to assess the gap on a continuous basis.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are widely used for various applications such as telecommunication, automotive, and stationary applications. With their wide range of safe operating temperatures (i.e. -10 °C to 50 °C), the Li-ion is preferred over other types of matured battery technologies such as lead acid and nickel-cadmium (NiCd). Nevertheless, operating the Li-ion batteries at cold climate conditions can potentially harm the batteries and lead to issues such as degradation and reduction in their capacity and power density. This paper aims to experimentally investigate the behavior of a Li-ion cell operating at low temperatures (i.e. -15 °C to 25 °C) with respect to its charging and discharging behavior. It was observed that at sub-zero temperatures (i.e. -5 °C, -10 °C and -15 °C) the Li-ion cell’s capacity is reduced due to the impedance effect which then increases the cell’s internal resistance. Moreover, at such low temperatures the best state of charge (SOC) of the cell (i.e. during charging mode) has reduced to about 723\% of its maximum initial SOC (i.e. 100\%). To complement the experimental finding, an existing simplified adaptive thermal model was used to obtain the discharge curves at various current rates based on the function of extracted charge (ܳ௢௨௧). The discharge curve of equilibrium potential (ܧ௘௤) is then extrapolated towards zero current in order to obtained the overpotential heat generation curve based on the discharge current of the cell. The result showed a good agreement to the discharge curves that were obtained experimentally. Likewise, with the finding of cell voltage (ܧሻ, current (ܫሻ and temperature (ܶሻ that were obtained experimentally, the thermal behavior of the cell in respect of its internal temperature is predicted and represented by comparing both the simulated and experimental cell internal temperatures.},

This paper presents a topology survey evaluating topologies for use in front end ac-dc converters for PHEV battery chargers. The topology survey is focused on several boost power factor corrected converters, which offer high efficiency, high power factor, high density and low cost. Experimental results are presented and interpreted for five prototype converters, converting universal ac input voltage to 400 V dc. The results demonstrate that the phase shifted semi-bridgeless PFC boost converter is ideally suited for automotive level I residential charging applications in North America, where the typical supply is limited to 120 V and 1.44 kVA. For automotive level II residential charging applications in North America and Europe the bridgeless interleaved PFC boost converter is an ideal topology candidate for typical supplies of 120 V and 240 V, with power levels of 3.3 kW, 5 kW and 6.6 kW.},

	abstract = {When charging or discharging electric vehicles, power losses occur in the vehicle and the building systems supplying the vehicle. A new use case for electric vehicles, grid services, has recently begun commercial operation. Vehicles capable of such application, called Grid-Integrated Vehicles, may have use cases with charging and discharging summing up to much more energy transfer than the charging only use case, so measuring and reducing electrical losses is even more important. In this study, the authors experimentally measure and analyze the power losses of a Grid-Integrated Vehicle system, via detailed measurement of the building circuits, power feed components, and of sample electric vehicle components. Under the conditions studied, measured total one-way losses vary from 12\% to 36\%, so understanding loss factors is important to efficient design and use. Predominant losses occur in the power electronics used for AC-DC conversion. The electronics efficiency is lowest at low power transfer and low state-of-charge, and is lower during discharging than charging. Based on these findings, two engineering design approaches are proposed. First, optimal sizing of charging stations is analyzed. Second, a dispatch algorithm for grid services operating at highest efficiency is developed, showing 7.0\% to 9.7\% less losses than the simple equal dispatch algorithm.},

	abstract = {The open circuit voltage (OCV) is an essential variable for accurate state of charge (SoC) estimation of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles (EVs). OCV test must be performed periodically to calibrate the OCV-SoC relationship after battery aging. Furthermore, due to pronounced hysteresis effects and wide flat regions in the OCV-SoC curves of LiFePO4 batteries, the traditional OCV tests often take three to five days to obtain data on one or more fully charge and discharge cycles, which are time-consuming and become unreliable under changing driving cycles and operating conditions. In addition, the OCV-SoC relationship determined in a certain aging stage cannot be used for the full life cycle and whole operating conditions. In this paper, the OCV-SoC relationship is extracted from any existing current-voltage measurements by using an H infinity filter within several seconds, which is verified under constant current conditions and dynamic conditions. Our results show that the estimated OCV can result in accurate SoC estimation with a maximum error of 1\%.},

	abstract = {Battery preheating at low temperatures is essential to ensure the efficient operation of electric vehicles in all climate conditions. Alternating current heating is proposed as an effective preheating method to improve the poor performance of lithium-ion batteries operated at low temperatures. To describe the dynamic voltage behavior accurately, the Butler-Volmer equation has been employed, and then a novel electro-thermal coupled model has been proposed for accurately calculating the thermal behavior of a battery. To obtain the optimal preheating performance, the electro-thermal coupled model-based available heating current computational method has been developed to obtain the optimal echelon preheating strategy. This method has the potential to balance the heat generation rate and degradation on battery lifetime. Finally, the proposed echelon heating strategy has been verified by battery cells and battery packs. Results show that the battery cell can be heated from the temperature of −20.3 °C to 10.02 °C by 13.7 min with an average temperature-rise 2.21 °C/min. And the battery pack can be heated from −20.84 °C to 10 °C by 12.4 min with an average temperature-rise is 2.47 °C/min.},

	abstract = {Mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is widely viewed as essential to address climate change and requires a compelling case for ownership worldwide. While the manufacturing costs and technical capabilities of EVs are similar across regions, customer needs and economic contexts vary widely. Assessments of the all-electric-range required to cover day-to-day driving demand, and the climate and economic beneﬁts of EVs, need to account for diﬀerences in regional characteristics and individual travel patterns. To meet this need travel proﬁles for 1681 light-duty passenger vehicles in China, the U.S., and Germany were used to make the ﬁrst consistent multiregional comparison of customer and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission beneﬁts of EVs. We show that despite diﬀerences in fuel prices, driving patterns, and subsidies, the economic beneﬁts/challenges of EVs are generally similar across regions. Individuals who are economically most likely to adopt EVs have GHG beneﬁts that are substantially greater than for average drivers. Such “priority” EV customers have large (32\%−63\%) reductions in cradle-to-grave GHG emissions. It is shown that low battery costs (below approximately \$100/kWh) and a portfolio of EV oﬀerings are required for mass adoption of electric vehicles.},

	abstract = {China has emerged as a leading electric vehicle (EV) market, accounting for approximately half of the global EV sales volume. We employed an atmospheric chemistry model to evaluate the air quality impacts from multiple scenarios by considering various EV penetration levels in China and assessed the avoided premature mortality attributed to fine particulate matter and ozone pollution. We find higher fleet electrification ratios can synergistically deliver greater air quality, climate and health benefits. For example, electrifying 27\% of private vehicles and a larger proportion of certain commercial fleets can readily reduce the annual concentrations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and summer concentrations of ozone by 2030. This scenario can reduce the number of annual premature deaths nationwide by 17,456 (95\% confidence interval: 10,656–22,160), with the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions accounting for {\textasciitilde}37\% of the total number. The high concentration of health benefits in populous megacities implies that their municipal governments should promote more supportive local incentives. This study further reveals that fleet electrification in China could have more health benefits than net climate benefits in the next decade, which should be realized by policymakers to develop cost-effective strategies for EV development.},

However, the benefits of grid-dependent EVs can only be harvested under the condition that their use is coupled with a low carbon electricity grid. Thus, it is an additional challenge for Malaysia's that are largely dependent on fossil fuels for electricity generation. The object of this paper is to perform a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the usage of ICEVs, HEVs and EVs in Malaysian scenario. These emission calculations will provide the best information for policymakers, researchers, and investors to make appropriate and effective decisions on policies, research and investments in future transport energy. The results show that running EVs with national grid will produce an average of 7\% more GHG emissions than HEVs at the same distance. However, they will produce an average of 19\% less GHG emissions than the ICEVs. Overall the GHG emissions produced through the usage of EVs are substantial based on the well-to-wheel analysis, as the environmental profile of EVs is linked with the national grid. Therefore, in order to harvest the benefit of EVs towards climate change and global warming mitigation, massive modernization and transformation should be taken for the development of the national grid towards greener sources.},

A novel agent-based simulation framework coupled with a detailed geo-referenced digital model of the built infrastructure is developed and applied. The charging behaviour of individual electric vehicle users as well as the spatial distributions of electric vehicles are accounted for in the simulation framework. More than 2500 scenarios of the transition to electric mobility in a mid-size city in Switzerland are assessed. The time to break-even of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure is up to 50\% shorter when users are charged on the basis of parking fees rather than power sales. However, the revenues from parking fees are shown to be more sensitive to the behaviours and preferences of the users. At today’s low penetrations of electric vehicles, the profitability of the charging infrastructure is very uncertain, and thus entrants into the marketplace will have substantial financial exposure until the penetrations are of order 10\%. Additionally, it is shown that, at specific transformers, public charging considerably increases grid loads by up to 78\% during peak hours; these local increases, rather than the average city-wide increase in load, are the critical determinant of the required upgrades to the distribution grid. Overall, this novel simulation framework facilitates the planning of electric vehicle charging infrastructure that will support a successful transition to electric mobility.},

	abstract = {With high electric vehicle (EV) adoption, optimization of the charging process of EVs is becoming increasingly important. Although the CO2 emission impact of EVs is heavily dependent on the generation mix at the moment of charging, emission minimization of EV charging receives limited attention. Generally, studies neglect the fact that cost and emission savings potential for EV charging can be constrained by the capacity limits of the low-voltage (LV) grid. Grid reinforcements provide EVs more freedom in minimizing charging costs and/or emissions, but also result in additional costs and emissions due to reinforcement of the grid. The first aim of this study is to present the trade-off between cost and emission minimization of EV charging. Second, to compare the costs and emissions of grid reinforcements with the potential cost and emission benefits of EV charging with grid reinforcements. This study proposes a method for multi-objective optimization of EV charging costs and/or emissions at low computational costs by aggregating individual EV batteries characteristics in a single EV charging model, considering vehicle-to-grid (V2G), EV battery degradation and the transformer capacity. The proposed method is applied to a case study grid in Utrecht, the Netherlands, using highly-detailed EV charging transaction data as input. The results of the analysis indicate that even when considering the current transformer capacity, cost savings up to 32.4\% compared to uncontrolled EV charging are possible when using V2G. Emission minimization can reduce emissions by 23.6\% while simultaneously reducing EV charging costs by 13.2\%. This study also shows that in most cases, the extra cost or emission benefits of EV charging under a higher transformer capacity limit do not outweigh the cost and emissions for upgrading that transformer.},

Plugin electric vehicles (PEVs) are becoming an alternative to vehicles powered by an internal combustion engine. This leads to environmental benefits, but these PEVs represent new challenges facing the power grid. Therefore, the power grid must be prepared for these challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive study of PEVs charging impact on the low voltage distribution grid. For this purpose, a typical Hungarian low voltage grid was modeled in DIgSILENT Power Factory. Two charging scenarios have been studied, uncoordinated charging and delayed charging. Three penetration levels of PEVs are considered in this paper as follows, 20\%, 40\%, and 60\% Time sweep analysis is used to investigate transformer loading, feeders loading, voltage deviation and system total losses. The results show that at 60\% penetration level with uncoordinated charging, both the distribution transformer and feeders thermal loading violation is experienced. On the contrast, with the delayed charging, all the grid components function at their normal rating at all penetration levels and no network upgrade is required.},

To evaluate the profitability of the FR service, the cost of degradation from FR provision is separated from the degradation caused by driving usage. During FR, the power response is proportional to the frequency deviation with full activation power of 9.2 kW, when deviations are larger than 100 mHz. The degradation due to FR is found to be an additional 1–2\% to the 7–12\% capacity reduction of a 40 kWh Lithium-ion NMC battery pack over 5 years. The overall economic framework is applied in Denmark, both DK1 and DK2, and Japan, by considering historical frequencies. The DK2 FR market framework is taken as reference also for the Japanese and the DK1 cases. Electricity prices and charger efficiency are the two main parameters that affect the profitability of the service. Indeed, with domestic prices there is no profitability, whereas with industrial prices, despite differences between the frequencies, the service is similarly profitable with approx. 3500€ for a five-year period.},

A PTM (probability transition matrix) is calculated at the aggregator side as the control signal to guide EV charging processes based on submitted EV charging schedules. Elements of the PTM represent the transition probabilities of moving a charging load from one time period to another. At the EV side, each EV individually updates its charging schedule according to its charging requirements and the PTM. Then the updated schedules are sent back to the aggregator. This process is repeated iteratively until convergence. In this method, no optimal control problems need to be solved locally so that its implementation on the EV side requires low computation capability. Simulation results show that the proposed method can create desired EV charging schedules for load valley filling within only several iterations, making it suitable for real-time implementation.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs), the impacts on power grids arising from EV charging have drawn increasing attention worldwide. Uncoordinated charging of large-scale EVs will inevitably elevate load peaks at rush hours, therefore, poses serious challenges to the stability and security of power grid. Coordinated charging is expected to alleviate these negative impacts by utilizing the surplus power in the lower-demand hours with the help of the so-called valley filling algorithm. Nevertheless, when the amount of EVs involved reaches 1 million or above, the complexity of the scheduling method becomes a critical issue. In this paper, a very high efficient valley-filling strategy is proposed. Two key indexes, viz., capacity margin index and charging priority index are defined, the former one is used to select the target time slots on which the power grid has abundant surplus power for EV charging, and the latter one is used to determine the charging priority of EVs on each time slot. The simulation results demonstrate that the coordinated charging scheme with the proposed valley-filling strategy significantly outperforms the uncoordinated charging in the aspect of suppressing the elevated peak loads of power grid. Moreover, the complexity analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is much high-efficient than its existing counterparts.},

To overcome the computational challenge when the control horizon is long, we study a nested optimization approach to decompose the joint OPF and EV charging problem. We characterize the optimal EV charging schedule to be a valley-filling profile, which allows us to develop an efficient offline algorithm with significantly lower computational complexity compared to centralized interior point solvers. Furthermore, we propose a decentralized online algorithm that dynamically tracks the valley-filling profile.

	abstract = {A multi-objective problem, namely, dynamic economic emission dispatch is simultaneously solved under several practical equality and inequality operating power constraints, while applying the load demand management (LDM) on 30,000 electric vehicles (EVs) during crest shaving and valley filling (CSVF) regions. A novel algorithm named orthogonal particle swarm optimization (OPSO) is proposed for such a problem. Ten thermal-generating units (TGUs) from power-generating systems (PGSs) in two Case Studies, with and without LDM on the load demand of 30,000 EVs, are tested. The comprehensive analysis results reveal that the quantity of emissions released by the 10 TGUs was remarkable affected and reduced around 4005 kg/day and the operating fuel cost was saved around \$409/day when applying the LDM on the load demand of 30,000 EVs in the CSVF regions. This study provides important outcomes about the future operation of PGSs when applying the LDM strategy on a large-scale penetration of EVs in smart cities into a sustainable environment. The study outcomes contribute in making the PGS flexible, economical, environmental, stable, and reliable.},

However such strategies can result in high charging power, raising the possibility of local overloads within the distribution grid and of accelerated battery degradation. The paper establishes a framework for PEV charging coordination that facilitates the tradeoff between total generation cost and the local costs associated with overloading and battery degradation. A decentralized approach to solving the resulting large-scale optimization problem involves each PEV minimizing their charging cost with respect to a forecast price profile while taking into account local grid and battery effects. The charging strategies proposed by participating PEVs are used to update the price profile which is subsequently rebroadcast to the PEVs. The process then repeats. It is shown that under mild conditions this iterative process converges to the unique, efficient (socially optimal) coordination strategy.},

First, each aggregator computes its aggregate charging load boundaries based on customer charging requirements and local transformer capacity limits. With the load boundaries of aggregators, a linear optimization model is then solved at the distribution system operator (DSO) level to generate the preferred charging curve for each aggregator. Finally, each aggregator intelligently allocates the charging power suggested by the DSO based on a fast heuristic algorithm. Case studies on four aggregators following different charging strategies are carried out. Simulation results indicate this charging coordination framework successfully achieves electricity cost minimization and system peak load controlling. Moreover, considering that part of profits of aggregators might be compromised by participating in charging coordination, a simple but clear compensation mechanism for aggregators is designed.},

Second level of SCMA is used during the charging process in order to provide cost-effective and reliable charging as well as less impact on power grid. The proposed SCMA strategy successfully routes the electric vehicles (EVs) to the most suitable charging point, decreases the charging costs and prevents the overloading of transformers.

Six study cases were considered: heavy duty gas turbines in simple and combined cycle, aero-derivative gas turbines, large-scale supercritical coal power plants and small- and mid-scale sub-critical coal power plants. The most critical operational processes and pollutants associated with these plants were identified. Then, data was collected mainly from manufacturers, but also from academic research and grey literature. The data was compared and analyzed. Detailed comparisons of the power plant characteristics as well as the current and future flexibility and emissions are provided. Furthermore, a method to quantify the ability of conventional power plants to back-up renewables and the expected benefits from improved flexibility is proposed and evaluated. Results show that gas-fired power plants are not only more efficient, but also faster and generally less polluting than coal-fired power plants. However, at their respective minimum complaint load, gas plants are less flexible and produced more NOx and CO emissions than coal-fired power plants. Results also show that on average, an improvement of approximately 50\% to 100\% on power ramp rates, minimum power load, number of major power cycles and emissions for these plants is sought in the future to complement renewables.},

It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.},

	abstract = {Plug-In electric vehicles (PEV) are in an early market phase in almost all markets. Still, the lack of public charging infrastructure is a barrier to PEV adoption. The assessment of future charging infrastructure needs is often based on key figures, mainly the ratio of PEV to public charging points. However, countries differ regarding their framework conditions, e.g. the availability of home charging, and the question of how much public charging infrastructure is needed cannot be answered equally for all countries. Yet, studies analyzing the framework conditions for the medium- to long-term demand for charging infrastructure are rare. Here, we review the existing literature and summarize the evidence for the importance of framework conditions on charging infrastructure needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the literature evidence by comparing the framework conditions for charging infrastructure in different countries based on a comprehensive dataset of framework parameters. We find public charging infrastructure as alternative to home charging is only needed in some densely populated areas. However, framework conditions vary largely among countries. Accordingly, findings from literature for specific countries can only be transferred to other countries to a limited extent.},

	abstract = {The ISO analysis has shown that variability and uncertainty of predicting renewable production do pose some operational challenges. The output from renewable production can increase and drop-off dramatically by hundreds of megawatts in just a matter of 30 minutes, which would require more flexible resources into the ISO’s generation mix. This need is compounded as California policy on once-through-cooling resources may result in the shutting-down of approximately 12,000 MW of conventional resources over the next 7 years. Managing a more complex grid during this transitional period, ensuring the right mix of resource are available in real-time to maintain reliability and meeting mandatory control performance standards become more of a challenge. As a result of this fleet evolution, there are real opportunities to design the fleet make up and incentivize new capability from a broad range of source including 1) demand response, 2) the variable resources themselves, 3) regional coordination, 4) storage and 5) hydro, in addition to the conventional resources to optimize meeting the policy objectives while ensuring basic grid reliability is maintained. On some days during the spring months, the ISO’s net-load is expected to drop to levels that encroach on non-dispatchable production levels when solar and wind production is high and system demand is low. Thus, in the middle of the day when the sun is shining there would be less need for additional supply resources. As time progresses to the evening hours towards sunset, there is an immediate need to replace the solar generation in addition to meeting increase in consumer demand. A complicating factor is that many of the conventional resources that could replace the solar generation must start prior to this significant ramp. These resources often require several hours to a day or more to fully come on line, which can cause more generation to be on line than consumer demand causing over generation conditions. Under existing arrangement solar (and wind) resources have limited provisions to be curtailed. Therefore as most conventional generators require this "start-up" time to reach their minimum load levels, at times the minimum energy on conventional resources may not be needed but the units cannot be shut down because the resources are needed later on during the day. There is little that a grid operator can do to accommodate this excess generation condition as supply and demand must match instantaneously. As over generation condition increase there would be a need to increase regional coordination by forming an Energy Imbalance Market to help mitigate the potential for over-generation conditions. Other solutions such as advanced demand response and storage may also be innovative solutions in the future to help balance the system during range of expected daily imbalance conditions. In addition, incentivizing the renewable resources to be flexible themselves may also be part of the solution. To reliably operate the system, the ISO is advocating for resource flexibility that can start up and provide its maximum energy quickly. An additional condition requiring flexible resources is the intra-hour variability of passing clouds or storm conditions that can interrupt the output of the wind and solar generation resources. Another operational condition that must be met in real-time is the need to ensure sufficient inertia and frequency response exists in the system. Today, conventional resources because of their rotating mass and ability to respond to changes in frequency provide a reliable shock absorber to disturbance events. As such resources are displaced by renewable resources, it will be important to ensure the system is able to respond to dynamic events in a stable manner. Again in this area, opportunities exist that would allow renewable resources to be part of the solution. There are also opportunities to make wider use of demand response and smart technologies to provide this primary frequency response capability.},

In this study, we model the evolution of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid, located in the midwestern United States (U.S.) with large numbers of forecasted EVs and renewable generation by the late 2030s, over the period 2019–2039. Uncontrolled charging leads to peak load increases of up to 10\% or 8 GW, and exacerbated ramping requirements. In contrast, controlled charging significantly ameliorates these challenges, with unidirectional (“V1G”) charging largely avoiding peak load increases, filling valley loads and reducing ramp rates. Bidirectional (“V2G”) charging provides much larger load flexibility to dramatically reduce peak loads and ramp rates. This study investigates EV load growth in the midwestern U.S. and the impact that different types of controlled charging can have on mitigating the grid challenges presented both by large numbers of EVs and increasing levels of renewable generation. Moreover, above {\textasciitilde}3 million EVs, V2G charging can exhibit multi-day optimization behavior and very high load flexibility, suggesting the possibility of new load planning tools extending over multiple days. Such capabilities would provide significant aid in optimally scheduling resources with a larger percentage of intermittent renewables.},

	abstract = {With high electric vehicle (EV) adoption, optimization of the charging process of EVs is becoming increasingly important. Although the CO2 emission impact of EVs is heavily dependent on the generation mix at the moment of charging, emission minimization of EV charging receives limited attention. Generally, studies neglect the fact that cost and emission savings potential for EV charging can be constrained by the capacity limits of the low-voltage (LV) grid. Grid reinforcements provide EVs more freedom in minimizing charging costs and/or emissions, but also result in additional costs and emissions due to reinforcement of the grid. The first aim of this study is to present the trade-off between cost and emission minimization of EV charging. Second, to compare the costs and emissions of grid reinforcements with the potential cost and emission benefits of EV charging with grid reinforcements. This study proposes a method for multi-objective optimization of EV charging costs and/or emissions at low computational costs by aggregating individual EV batteries characteristics in a single EV charging model, considering vehicle-to-grid (V2G), EV battery degradation and the transformer capacity. The proposed method is applied to a case study grid in Utrecht, the Netherlands, using highly-detailed EV charging transaction data as input. The results of the analysis indicate that even when considering the current transformer capacity, cost savings up to 32.4\% compared to uncontrolled EV charging are possible when using V2G. Emission minimization can reduce emissions by 23.6\% while simultaneously reducing EV charging costs by 13.2\%. This study also shows that in most cases, the extra cost or emission benefits of EV charging under a higher transformer capacity limit do not outweigh the cost and emissions for upgrading that transformer.},

We ﬁnd that controlled electric vehicle charging can reduce associated generation costs by 23\%−34\% in part by shifting loads to lower-cost, higher-emitting coal plants. This shift results in increased externality costs of health and environmental damages from increased air pollution. On balance, we ﬁnd that controlled charging of electric vehicles produces negative net social beneﬁts in the recent PJM grid but could have positive net social beneﬁts in a future grid with suﬃcient coal retirements and wind penetration.},

	abstract = {Electrification of urban transportation systems is an important path towards achieving low carbon transportation and meeting climate commitments. Despite zero on-road greenhouse gas emissions, the upstream emissions from electricity generation cannot be ignored. In this study, a heuristic algorithm was designed to optimize regional electric vehicle charging schedules with the objective of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation. Our study is set in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Emissions from the charging demand are estimated by a marginal emission model calibrated with historical data for Ontario electricity generation. The results illustrate that the optimized plan can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 97\% compared to a base case, where vehicles are powered by gasoline. Four other charging scenarios (home, out of home, after trip, and after 3am) that do not entail optimization were also investigated and compared with the optimized plan. The scenario where charging is only allowed after 3am generates the lowest emissions among all four scenarios but its emissions are 50\% higher than the optimized scenario. Charging at the end of each trip was observed to generate the highest emissions. Locations serving the most charging events, and the number of non-residential charging plugs were also evaluated. The home location serves most charging events, followed by workplace. The optimized plan requires the second highest number of public charging plugs . This implies a trade-off between greenhouse gas emissions associated with vehicle charging and investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure.},
